After backtesting #DTFX For weeks now, here's my two cents on what you should focus on first üëáüèª

- Market Structure : The structure isn't about highs and lows but validated highs and lows (VH & VL), 
                    you should focus on spotting the right movement by validating your highs and lows.

- Zones : It's the movement that caused a continuation and or break of structure.
        Again ! A validated Zone should contain a validated high and a validated low (VZ). 

The zone consists of Two fractals that should be considered as :
- SDR (The last movement that causes the break of structure and or a continuation)
- The origin (the original move that caused a break of structure and or a continuation.

Price will always come back to mitigate the SDR and the original move, 
you can trade both of the zones because price will give you a good reaction for a 1:1 to 1:3R trades within these moves. 

If you mark up your zones and price comes to it, 
all you have to do is to wait for the price to shift on the LTF to give you an additional confirmation. 

Count your swings, Price will usually take 4 to 6 swings before shifting direction.
(Swing points are the moves between a VH & VL) 

Here's in the picture what a validated low (down close candle) and a validated high (up close candle) look like. 
Again ! If you are feeling manipulated by price, it's not the market's fault ... Go backtest and see what you are reading wrongly.

If the market is doing X it will do Y and so on...
Again ! Go backtest, no one is here to save you
