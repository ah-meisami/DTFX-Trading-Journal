looking for this

60
00:07:15,120 --> 00:07:19,759
here the beginning of that Wick even

61
00:07:19,759 --> 00:07:24,199
if dodgy has the high being taken

62
00:07:24,199 --> 00:07:26,280
out I'm still looking for the beginning

63
00:07:26,280 --> 00:07:30,919
of the week there um that's usually my

64
00:07:30,919 --> 00:07:33,000
exit

00:07:33,000 --> 00:07:37,840
um and speaking of uh exits I'm

66
00:07:37,840 --> 00:07:41,479
actually uh let me see I'm actually in

67
00:07:41,479 --> 00:07:44,520
on this right

68
00:07:44,520 --> 00:07:48,280
here sorry this is where it

69
00:07:48,280 --> 00:07:51,639
started you guys can see this right this

70
00:07:51,639 --> 00:07:55,039
this is where the entry

71
00:07:55,039 --> 00:07:58,599
started right here right at that 42 it

72
00:07:58,599 --> 00:08:01,000
was actually 3 9 but it didn't give me

73
00:08:01,000 --> 00:08:04,560
an opportunity to get in that 39 is

74
00:08:04,560 --> 00:08:07,479
something um that I alerted the Discord

75
00:08:07,479 --> 00:08:11,599
on um because of our previous range down

76
00:08:11,599 --> 00:08:14,599
below here and that 39 is where I was

77
00:08:14,599 --> 00:08:16,240
sorry looking for the long and I was

78
00:08:16,240 --> 00:08:17,720
looking for price to at least just

79
00:08:17,720 --> 00:08:19,680
deliver the one to one so the one: one

80
00:08:19,680 --> 00:08:21,639
is at this high right

81
00:08:21,639 --> 00:08:23,560
here looking for price to at least

82
00:08:23,560 --> 00:08:26,759
delivered a one to one there and um that

83
00:08:26,759 --> 00:08:29,879
was about 78 points away as you guys see

84
00:08:29,879 --> 00:08:32,279
this 39 to this

85
00:08:32,279 --> 00:08:35,080
117 you know quite a bit of points away

86
00:08:35,080 --> 00:08:37,200
but when we have this news Wick here we

87
00:08:37,200 --> 00:08:39,839
know that price often times come comes

88
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,719
back to Target the beginning of that

89
00:08:42,719 --> 00:08:44,039
Wick

90
00:08:44,039 --> 00:08:48,240
so that just extends it you know um you

91
00:08:48,240 --> 00:08:50,800
know just a little more just based on

92
00:08:50,800 --> 00:08:54,040
narrative or so uh but it's a nice

93
00:08:54,040 --> 00:08:59,040
little uh Banger right there

94
00:08:59,560 --> 00:09:01,240
uh that

95
00:09:01,240 --> 00:09:04,519
was uh

96
00:09:04,519 --> 00:09:06,720
called for you

97
00:09:06,720 --> 00:09:08,560
guys

98
00:09:08,560 --> 00:09:11,800
um let me just show you guys where I'm

99
00:09:11,800 --> 00:09:14,640
at now I'm actually

100
00:09:14,640 --> 00:09:18,760
gonna have this position

101
00:09:19,959 --> 00:09:23,720
closed I'm going to close this position

102
00:09:23,720 --> 00:09:25,839
but I'm right

103
00:09:25,839 --> 00:09:31,160
here this is still from the same low

104
00:09:31,839 --> 00:09:34,760
the same load that was down there being

105
00:09:34,760 --> 00:09:37,360
able to just ride that on up because you

106
00:09:37,360 --> 00:09:38,800
know it's delivering the higher time

107
00:09:38,800 --> 00:09:41,480
frame one to one there right the zone

108
00:09:41,480 --> 00:09:43,079
right there 50% there you know it's

109
00:09:43,079 --> 00:09:45,200
delivering at one to one so you ride it

110
00:09:45,200 --> 00:09:47,920
up but these circumstances show trading

111
00:09:47,920 --> 00:09:50,000
back into this direction we know news

112
00:09:50,000 --> 00:09:52,079
happened here so often times what do we

113
00:09:52,079 --> 00:09:55,360
do we go and grab that news Wick so what

114
00:09:55,360 --> 00:09:57,959
do you usually Target the beginning of

115
00:09:57,959 --> 00:09:59,720
that news Wick cuz you're not always

116
00:09:59,720 --> 00:10:02,560
entirely sure that the news Wick will be

117
00:10:02,560 --> 00:10:05,000
taken just like down

118
00:10:05,000 --> 00:10:08,200
here dodgy could tell you that sometimes

119
00:10:08,200 --> 00:10:09,600
they don't take the

120
00:10:09,600 --> 00:10:12,279
wick this is the news wig down below

121
00:10:12,279 --> 00:10:15,200
right here

122
00:10:15,800 --> 00:10:18,279
right there's the news Wick there's the

123
00:10:18,279 --> 00:10:21,640
beginning of the wick as the exit right

124
00:10:21,640 --> 00:10:24,200
right there there's that clean exit but

125
00:10:24,200 --> 00:10:26,480
it doesn't take that low and imagine

126
00:10:26,480 --> 00:10:28,920
being at break even all the way up here

127
00:10:28,920 --> 00:10:31,120
some somewhere in this region here and

128
00:10:31,120 --> 00:10:33,160
it not taking that and going right back

129
00:10:33,160 --> 00:10:34,839
to your entry are you kidding me you got

130
00:10:34,839 --> 00:10:37,839
to be out of your mind I'm

131
00:10:37,839 --> 00:10:43,480
not not the bag hold it type so

132
00:10:43,839 --> 00:10:48,279
um that was a nice

133
00:10:48,839 --> 00:10:50,839
little

134
00:10:50,839 --> 00:10:53,399
uh nice little long we

135
00:10:53,399 --> 00:10:55,519
rode to the

136
00:10:55,519 --> 00:10:57,320
top

137
00:10:57,320 --> 00:11:00,560
um and when when this kind of extension

138
00:11:00,560 --> 00:11:03,360
happens here when this kind of extension

139
00:11:03,360 --> 00:11:05,680
happens here like that your business is

140
00:11:05,680 --> 00:11:09,680
below here if it retraces and above here

141
00:11:09,680 --> 00:11:11,800
should price take the high anything in

142
00:11:11,800 --> 00:11:15,720
between that you're not trying to take

143
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:19,079
part in this entry here to go further to

144
00:11:19,079 --> 00:11:20,760
take this high right here you're not

145
00:11:20,760 --> 00:11:23,320
trying to fight this this high in here

146
00:11:23,320 --> 00:11:26,440
to go in short down below

147
00:11:26,440 --> 00:11:29,760
um you know you don't pick up a mindset

148
00:11:29,760 --> 00:11:32,519
to do any of that unless obviously your

149
00:11:32,519 --> 00:11:34,519
your plan has showed up what are you

150
00:11:34,519 --> 00:11:37,360
exactly shorting up here if you were to

151
00:11:37,360 --> 00:11:40,360
short I think for me I saw a five minute

152
00:11:40,360 --> 00:11:44,120
oh there we go the the flag handle there

153
00:11:44,120 --> 00:11:48,120
there we go so um you know we obviously

154
00:11:48,120 --> 00:11:49,800
hit that there so that warrants that

155
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:51,720
move back into this range you know that

156
00:11:51,720 --> 00:11:54,160
this um first balance could very well

157
00:11:54,160 --> 00:11:56,720
put in a new high above this high so you

158
00:11:56,720 --> 00:12:00,519
still don't want to uh pick up that

159
00:12:00,519 --> 00:12:04,160
insatiable desire to short when price is

160
00:12:04,160 --> 00:12:06,959
clearly still moving in the the the

161
00:12:06,959 --> 00:12:09,000
upward direction we have quite a bit of

162
00:12:09,000 --> 00:12:12,600
swings here though uh one two three this

163
00:12:12,600 --> 00:12:14,720
would be the fourth one if it takes this

164
00:12:14,720 --> 00:12:18,000
high right here um so it's quite a bit

165
00:12:18,000 --> 00:12:20,760
of swings on this extension up but I

166
00:12:20,760 --> 00:12:24,079
would be expecting price to um take that

167
00:12:24,079 --> 00:12:25,160
high up

168
00:12:25,160 --> 00:12:30,320
there that the news Wick high so if you

169
00:12:30,320 --> 00:12:32,480
weren't able to find your opportunity

170
00:12:32,480 --> 00:12:34,959
within here I'm sure dodgy got in right

171
00:12:34,959 --> 00:12:38,240
here because that's the Run of his lows

172
00:12:38,240 --> 00:12:41,199
right the Run of um you know the draw

173
00:12:41,199 --> 00:12:46,399
was Asia so there's his imbalance that

174
00:12:46,399 --> 00:12:49,279
forms price closes up above the high of

175
00:12:49,279 --> 00:12:50,680
the imbalance I'm sure his little

176
00:12:50,680 --> 00:12:52,720
partial points like along these Wicks

177
00:12:52,720 --> 00:12:55,120
here and then his Terminus

178
00:12:55,120 --> 00:12:59,800
is the the high up there as well

179
00:12:59,800 --> 00:13:02,600
so uh you know many different people see

180
00:13:02,600 --> 00:13:05,639
uh different reasons as to why they

181
00:13:05,639 --> 00:13:08,800
would get into an opportunity to Target

182
00:13:08,800 --> 00:13:12,920
anything to the upside but for me um you

183
00:13:12,920 --> 00:13:14,560
know this is always going to be it price

184
00:13:14,560 --> 00:13:18,279
Taps right into my zone and trades right

185
00:13:18,279 --> 00:13:21,959
into the previous range so um or

186
00:13:21,959 --> 00:13:24,880
delivers that one to one on that high

187
00:13:24,880 --> 00:13:28,360
now just because the one: one is here

188
00:13:28,360 --> 00:13:30,680
does not mean that your stop loss has to

189
00:13:30,680 --> 00:13:32,639
be all the way down here for your entry

190
00:13:32,639 --> 00:13:33,680
to be

191
00:13:33,680 --> 00:13:36,240
here this is just the invalidation of

192
00:13:36,240 --> 00:13:38,680
the idea but the idea can come from down

193
00:13:38,680 --> 00:13:42,720
here and make its way up to deliver that

194
00:13:42,720 --> 00:13:46,600
now like that it can come from lower

195
00:13:46,600 --> 00:13:48,839
down here but the invalidation of the

196
00:13:48,839 --> 00:13:52,360
idea would be behind that zone there but

197
00:13:52,360 --> 00:13:54,480
you see price just perfectly tapped on

198
00:13:54,480 --> 00:13:58,560
to 39 uh and and you know ran out of

199
00:13:58,560 --> 00:14:00,720
there so

200
00:14:00,720 --> 00:14:03,240
uh it was a dead giveaway uh when it

201
00:14:03,240 --> 00:14:07,160
came to uh Market

202
00:14:08,600 --> 00:14:12,040
open so I'm just waiting

203
00:14:12,040 --> 00:14:15,279
to waiting for that

204
00:14:15,279 --> 00:14:19,120
delivery um like I said at least to here

205
00:14:19,120 --> 00:14:20,560
uh this

206
00:14:20,560 --> 00:14:24,079
58 and then potentially the the high up

207
00:14:24,079 --> 00:14:27,079
above

208
00:14:33,160 --> 00:14:35,680
so hope you guys are able

209
00:14:35,680 --> 00:14:38,800
to capitalize on

210
00:14:38,800 --> 00:14:42,480
that because I know I

211
00:14:43,160 --> 00:14:47,800
did Target filled

212
00:14:48,480 --> 00:14:52,120
maybe there we go it is

213
00:14:52,120 --> 00:14:55,920
Terminus mentorship students know that

214
00:14:55,920 --> 00:14:57,199
kind of

215
00:14:57,199 --> 00:14:59,959
exit that I tend to make make especially

216
00:14:59,959 --> 00:15:03,040
when we form that candle there the exit

217
00:15:03,040 --> 00:15:05,199
that I'm making is right up above that

218
00:15:05,199 --> 00:15:06,720
candle because price can take out the

219
00:15:06,720 --> 00:15:08,519
high of that and then go back below it

220
00:15:08,519 --> 00:15:10,759
and why do I want to sit in all of that

221
00:15:10,759 --> 00:15:13,839
just for continued delivery might as

222
00:15:13,839 --> 00:15:18,000
well just step out at the the you know

223
00:15:18,000 --> 00:15:20,160
highest point of volume before it begins

224
00:15:20,160 --> 00:15:22,800
to lean to the other

225
00:15:22,800 --> 00:15:28,560
side so yeah that that was a nice uh

226
00:15:29,240 --> 00:15:30,880
nice little delivery somebody said it

227
00:15:30,880 --> 00:15:32,639
was news or something like that I didn't

228
00:15:32,639 --> 00:15:36,240
I didn't see that and they the um was it

229
00:15:36,240 --> 00:15:41,560
9:45 I didn't see that any the

230
00:15:43,519 --> 00:15:48,240
candlesticks maybe it wasn't a high

231
00:15:52,639 --> 00:15:55,759
impact oh okay it was it was a orange

232
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:59,240
fold there

233
00:16:09,920 --> 00:16:13,759
all right PMI still below expansion

234
00:16:13,759 --> 00:16:17,399
levels but still above

235
00:16:20,639 --> 00:16:26,240
expectations and consumer sentiment will

236
00:16:29,480 --> 00:16:31,440
see what they give us but that that was

237
00:16:31,440 --> 00:16:36,680
a nice uh little run there

238
00:16:37,399 --> 00:16:40,759
um to

239
00:16:42,920 --> 00:16:46,480
that wake up

240
00:16:47,120 --> 00:16:49,600
above I guess this is that consumer

241
00:16:49,600 --> 00:16:53,120
sentiment candle

242
00:16:59,480 --> 00:17:01,920
and guys do do you do you need any more

243
00:17:01,920 --> 00:17:04,160
of that like do you do would I really

244
00:17:04,160 --> 00:17:07,720
need to to get more as much as I can to

245
00:17:07,720 --> 00:17:09,880
have the highest and the most in the you

246
00:17:09,880 --> 00:17:11,799
know it really doesn't make

247
00:17:11,799 --> 00:17:13,919
sense you know especially if you're in

248
00:17:13,919 --> 00:17:17,000
from a move down here being Nimble here

249
00:17:17,000 --> 00:17:21,000
and not having a habit of trying to push

250
00:17:21,000 --> 00:17:24,640
this right here will say to you guys a

251
00:17:24,640 --> 00:17:28,480
lot of losses a lot of break evens not

252
00:17:28,480 --> 00:17:30,919
Target getting that right

253
00:17:30,919 --> 00:17:33,760
there so nice consumer sentiment just

254
00:17:33,760 --> 00:17:37,000
you know ran us up above that which is

255
00:17:37,000 --> 00:17:43,039
great um I did have a price going

256
00:17:43,039 --> 00:17:45,919
higher because we see some stuff back

257
00:17:45,919 --> 00:17:49,320
here that we're involved in

258
00:17:49,320 --> 00:17:52,960
um let's see there

259
00:17:52,960 --> 00:17:57,039
there there so let's at least see if we

260
00:17:57,039 --> 00:18:00,840
can get it to here

261
00:18:16,280 --> 00:18:20,720
overall let me see

262
00:18:43,280 --> 00:18:46,000
yeah overall I'm thinking here I was

263
00:18:46,000 --> 00:18:48,640
looking to get up above this here but

264
00:18:48,640 --> 00:18:50,400
you could have a rejection right here or

265
00:18:50,400 --> 00:18:53,080
somewhere um between this here but

266
00:18:53,080 --> 00:18:56,360
overall I see it getting up above

267
00:18:56,360 --> 00:19:00,760
that just based on going one time FR

268
00:19:00,760 --> 00:19:03,280
out

269
00:19:03,280 --> 00:19:06,520
so pushing that high

270
00:19:06,520 --> 00:19:10,720
now we get up into here we know that

271
00:19:10,720 --> 00:19:12,520
there's a possibility that what it's

272
00:19:12,520 --> 00:19:16,360
it's 10:00 now maybe 10:30 or so let's

273
00:19:16,360 --> 00:19:19,400
see what this

274
00:19:19,400 --> 00:19:23,679
um actually does because this is the new

275
00:19:23,679 --> 00:19:28,039
4our low right here that's been put in

276
00:19:28,039 --> 00:19:33,600
and this is a where the 4 Hour

277
00:19:33,600 --> 00:19:37,280
start started

278
00:19:37,280 --> 00:19:42,400
here so this is a 4our wick down below

279
00:19:42,400 --> 00:19:46,080
and then we move the and this is the

280
00:19:46,080 --> 00:19:50,120
bullish continuation of that 4our Wick

281
00:19:50,120 --> 00:19:51,280
that's in

282
00:19:51,280 --> 00:19:56,080
there so that means that that down move

283
00:19:56,080 --> 00:20:00,559
now this is the 4our candle extending

284
00:20:00,559 --> 00:20:04,960
that momentum up to potentially a 4-Hour

285
00:20:04,960 --> 00:20:09,080
High some kind of

286
00:20:10,960 --> 00:20:13,760
um ah okay yeah that's what I'm seeing

287
00:20:13,760 --> 00:20:17,559
then there's that 4our fractal and I'm

288
00:20:17,559 --> 00:20:19,400
potentially looking for price to get up

289
00:20:19,400 --> 00:20:22,080
above that 4H hour fractal that's right

290
00:20:22,080 --> 00:20:25,799
there so 4our moves have 4our

291
00:20:25,799 --> 00:20:28,960
targets and you do not

292
00:20:28,960 --> 00:20:32,000
fight against that Target until it is

293
00:20:32,000 --> 00:20:35,200
achieved and then that's when price will

294
00:20:35,200 --> 00:20:39,080
look to consolidate and then turn around

295
00:20:39,080 --> 00:20:41,919
the other way so

296
00:20:41,919 --> 00:20:44,919
um it's in this 4H hour fractal and it's

297
00:20:44,919 --> 00:20:46,440
more than likely looking for this 4H

298
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:48,720
hour high as I mentioned this is a 4

299
00:20:48,720 --> 00:20:52,799
Hour um candle so you're that momentum

300
00:20:52,799 --> 00:20:55,039
that 4our momentum is on your side

301
00:20:55,039 --> 00:20:59,679
leading to a 4our run of something

302
00:20:59,679 --> 00:21:00,960
that's what you have to remember when

303
00:21:00,960 --> 00:21:04,320
you're in 4our moves it's heading to a

304
00:21:04,320 --> 00:21:08,320
4H hour run of something so we know that

305
00:21:08,320 --> 00:21:10,919
this is the 4our POI that is in here

306
00:21:10,919 --> 00:21:14,400
this 4our fractal but I would more or

307
00:21:14,400 --> 00:21:17,200
less be anticipating price to get up

308
00:21:17,200 --> 00:21:20,440
above this tick right up above this and

309
00:21:20,440 --> 00:21:23,320
then drop back within

310
00:21:23,320 --> 00:21:26,799
it or maybe leave behind a wick maybe

311
00:21:26,799 --> 00:21:30,520
leave behind a wick so so that would

312
00:21:30,520 --> 00:21:34,600
be this 10:00 opening push that comes up

313
00:21:34,600 --> 00:21:37,840
and nearest to lunchtime that would mean

314
00:21:37,840 --> 00:21:39,440
that we would be back

315
00:21:39,440 --> 00:21:43,240
here back to wherever we currently

316
00:21:43,240 --> 00:21:46,960
are to leave that Wick there and then

317
00:21:46,960 --> 00:21:52,840
that 2:00 Wick trades up above that 4our

318
00:21:52,840 --> 00:21:57,200
candle and then now looks to trade down

319
00:21:57,200 --> 00:21:59,279
into wherever

320
00:21:59,279 --> 00:22:02,000
it would have came out which is that POI

321
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,000
there so that's how it would look you

322
00:22:05,000 --> 00:22:10,120
know um over the session over the

323
00:22:10,120 --> 00:22:11,880
session

324
00:22:11,880 --> 00:22:16,159
um but so just keep that in

325
00:22:19,760 --> 00:22:22,919
mind so you see this there still running

326
00:22:22,919 --> 00:22:24,840
up to there we would expect that we

327
00:22:24,840 --> 00:22:27,120
would expect some form of a pullback

328
00:22:27,120 --> 00:22:29,720
after we get up above here and that can

329
00:22:29,720 --> 00:22:33,480
just be a little um uh sort of

330
00:22:33,480 --> 00:22:36,360
consolidating there to what maybe dip

331
00:22:36,360 --> 00:22:39,960
into a five minute imbalance or or you

332
00:22:39,960 --> 00:22:42,039
know some higher time frame imbalance

333
00:22:42,039 --> 00:22:43,840
that it might leave behind there and

334
00:22:43,840 --> 00:22:45,400
then you know that first higher time

335
00:22:45,400 --> 00:22:48,200
frame imbalance puts in a new high you

336
00:22:48,200 --> 00:22:51,480
know so it it looks like you know we

337
00:22:51,480 --> 00:22:52,960
have quite the

338
00:22:52,960 --> 00:22:57,440
push um to the top side from this

339
00:22:57,440 --> 00:23:00,360
low and I know everybody's like hey you

340
00:23:00,360 --> 00:23:02,640
know wouldn't it have been better if you

341
00:23:02,640 --> 00:23:04,279
just held all the way yeah that would

342
00:23:04,279 --> 00:23:06,360
have been a banging trade you know that

343
00:23:06,360 --> 00:23:07,440
that have been

344
00:23:07,440 --> 00:23:09,919
amazing but it's not every day that that

345
00:23:09,919 --> 00:23:12,279
you come by that that kind of extension

346
00:23:12,279 --> 00:23:14,960
coming out of there so you got to be

347
00:23:14,960 --> 00:23:17,600
content with you know where you pay

348
00:23:17,600 --> 00:23:18,919
yourself what you get out of the move

349
00:23:18,919 --> 00:23:21,120
for the show back up tomorrow or or

350
00:23:21,120 --> 00:23:23,720
whenever the Market opens back up Sunday

351
00:23:23,720 --> 00:23:26,720
right

352
00:23:35,240 --> 00:23:39,720
I was happy with my plus 3.6R trade then

353
00:23:39,720 --> 00:23:43,240
priced with another 200 points listen we

354
00:23:43,240 --> 00:23:46,240
we were all we were all at least on the

355
00:23:46,240 --> 00:23:49,600
right side right we we were all we were

356
00:23:49,600 --> 00:23:51,440
all on the right side of the market at

357
00:23:51,440 --> 00:23:55,600
least at least that matters

358
00:24:01,640 --> 00:24:04,159

00:24:41,760 --> 00:24:45,640
market review uh later today about this

372
00:24:45,640 --> 00:24:48,080
uh entry as well but this is It's

373
00:24:48,080 --> 00:24:50,600
self-explanatory you know like come on

374
00:24:50,600 --> 00:24:53,200
we we we know how we trade right we

375
00:24:53,200 --> 00:24:55,440
follow Market structure on the way up

376
00:24:55,440 --> 00:24:57,720
right that's what we we all do that

377
00:24:57,720 --> 00:25:01,840
right that n and meat right so uh you

378
00:25:01,840 --> 00:25:04,720
know when you have this high that breaks

379
00:25:04,720 --> 00:25:07,360
there and you got this low here right

380
00:25:07,360 --> 00:25:11,039
that's that first move there we dip into

381
00:25:11,039 --> 00:25:13,360
it right here right and you see a move

382
00:25:13,360 --> 00:25:16,159
higher right so

383
00:25:16,159 --> 00:25:19,039
now there's that second swing there

384
00:25:19,039 --> 00:25:21,880
right we dip into it

385
00:25:21,880 --> 00:25:27,200
bam trade higher off of it now here's

386
00:25:27,200 --> 00:25:30,679
another one created here right so we dip

387
00:25:30,679 --> 00:25:33,440
into it again and then what trade higher

388
00:25:33,440 --> 00:25:35,840
off of it right then we create another

389
00:25:35,840 --> 00:25:38,080
one there right so you're just literally

390
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:40,000
following lows or or this is why the

391
00:25:40,000 --> 00:25:41,919
trend line Traders they make they make

392
00:25:41,919 --> 00:25:44,440
more money than everybody else because

393
00:25:44,440 --> 00:25:46,600
they just follow whatever the market is

394
00:25:46,600 --> 00:25:49,200
doing downtrend let's trying to find a

395
00:25:49,200 --> 00:25:51,440
move going down and if it surprised me

396
00:25:51,440 --> 00:25:53,760
and go up okay does the trend line break

397
00:25:53,760 --> 00:25:56,480
now I can find a move going up and we

398
00:25:56,480 --> 00:25:58,520
kind of just over complicate everything

399
00:25:58,520 --> 00:26:02,480
else by you know just trying to be

400
00:26:02,480 --> 00:26:05,440
contrarian there a 4our 4H hour

401
00:26:05,440 --> 00:26:07,240
extension who who GNA be shorten that

402
00:26:07,240 --> 00:26:08,880
from up

403
00:26:08,880 --> 00:26:14,159
here let Dody brag about his

404
00:26:14,840 --> 00:26:18,240
uh his inversion was set up for life I

405
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:21,600
I'm telling you know he 100% I watch him

406
00:26:21,600 --> 00:26:23,919
develop that from going from being

407
00:26:23,919 --> 00:26:27,159
uncertain about it to to now you know

408
00:26:27,159 --> 00:26:30,440
being very conf confident in calling it

409
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,559
uh Win Lose or Draw I've watch him

410
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:36,080
develop that so you know it it's

411
00:26:36,080 --> 00:26:38,000
interesting to see that stuff you know

412
00:26:38,000 --> 00:26:43,840
sort of play out um that way and you

413
00:26:43,840 --> 00:26:48,200
have profitable losers cigar delivery

414
00:26:48,200 --> 00:26:51,679
down right to

415
00:26:51,679 --> 00:26:56,480
dodgy uh uh one setup for life on his uh

416
00:26:56,480 --> 00:26:59,600
uh invers inversion going up right so

417
00:26:59,600 --> 00:27:03,200
that's one one strategy there there's

418
00:27:03,200 --> 00:27:06,760
another strategy there right you have

419
00:27:06,760 --> 00:27:09,080
the swing the 50% of the swing that we

420
00:27:09,080 --> 00:27:11,840
were using that that's us you know

421
00:27:11,840 --> 00:27:15,240
utilizing the swing points to be able to

422
00:27:15,240 --> 00:27:18,240
uh trade from them you have

423
00:27:18,240 --> 00:27:21,720
um uh you know this here is what people

424
00:27:21,720 --> 00:27:24,120
would consider the sndr the thing that

425
00:27:24,120 --> 00:27:27,440
sent price up to break this high up

426
00:27:27,440 --> 00:27:30,640
above here so this is price hitting that

427
00:27:30,640 --> 00:27:33,200
um snd responsible as well this is us

428
00:27:33,200 --> 00:27:35,799
tapping to 30% of the snd responsible

429
00:27:35,799 --> 00:27:38,080
there's a lot of stuff going on in here

430
00:27:38,080 --> 00:27:40,000
this is the break of I mean this

431
00:27:40,000 --> 00:27:42,519
mentorship material but it's is mm's you

432
00:27:42,519 --> 00:27:45,720
know like there's there's a ton of stuff

433
00:27:45,720 --> 00:27:50,399
happening inside of this entire Dynamic

434
00:27:50,399 --> 00:27:53,799
here to be able to pay somebody taking a

435
00:27:53,799 --> 00:27:55,600
short heading down pay somebody taking a

436
00:27:55,600 --> 00:27:57,440
long heading up pay somebody taking a

437
00:27:57,440 --> 00:28:02,200
little you know quick scalp um uh uh you

438
00:28:02,200 --> 00:28:04,840
know minor pullback from up above here

439
00:28:04,840 --> 00:28:06,679
you know the there's a ton of stuff

440
00:28:06,679 --> 00:28:09,720
within here and it's all about just

441
00:28:09,720 --> 00:28:13,120
being there when it happens now the the

442
00:28:13,120 --> 00:28:14,799
biggest issue that ends up happening

443
00:28:14,799 --> 00:28:18,080
with people is

444
00:28:18,080 --> 00:28:20,880
that when they get something like this

445
00:28:20,880 --> 00:28:23,640
or or let's even say AO like

446
00:28:23,640 --> 00:28:26,519
this this is what cost

447
00:28:26,519 --> 00:28:28,679
them right

448
00:28:28,679 --> 00:28:32,919
you see how we went up on this Wick we

449
00:28:32,919 --> 00:28:36,120
pushed up on that Wick real sharp

450
00:28:36,120 --> 00:28:38,399
looking like we were trading back into

451
00:28:38,399 --> 00:28:40,600
that direction this is where everybody's

452
00:28:40,600 --> 00:28:42,640
thinking okay price is going to trade

453
00:28:42,640 --> 00:28:45,880
higher then it ends up trading lower

454
00:28:45,880 --> 00:28:49,200
right so after it trades

455
00:28:49,200 --> 00:28:51,760
lower what people end up doing is

456
00:28:51,760 --> 00:28:54,519
grabbing this as a Zone to

457
00:28:54,519 --> 00:28:58,240
use because now

458
00:28:58,240 --> 00:29:01,840
that's a Zone to short right and what

459
00:29:01,840 --> 00:29:04,120
you see is price go right through that

460
00:29:04,120 --> 00:29:06,279
zone but they were looking for a zone

461
00:29:06,279 --> 00:29:08,679
now changing bias to short down and take

462
00:29:08,679 --> 00:29:10,679
out this low here because they said oh

463
00:29:10,679 --> 00:29:13,399
yeah there's tons of liquidity down

464
00:29:13,399 --> 00:29:15,880
these are people that they they know

465
00:29:15,880 --> 00:29:17,559
where the liquidity has but don't don't

466
00:29:17,559 --> 00:29:19,640
know where to put the stop loss it turns

467
00:29:19,640 --> 00:29:21,279
of liquidity down below I don't have

468
00:29:21,279 --> 00:29:23,279
enough money to run run any of that I

469
00:29:23,279 --> 00:29:25,399
can't really say that that's there's

470
00:29:25,399 --> 00:29:26,960
something that's going to happen you

471
00:29:26,960 --> 00:29:28,760
know because of something IM balance

472
00:29:28,760 --> 00:29:31,960
that one here in one minute

473
00:29:31,960 --> 00:29:34,720
but you hit

474
00:29:34,720 --> 00:29:37,919
this right there you have this break

475
00:29:37,919 --> 00:29:41,440
Above This high right here with a wick

476
00:29:41,440 --> 00:29:45,440
right and what you have is

477
00:29:48,360 --> 00:29:53,039
price tap right back into

478
00:29:53,080 --> 00:29:56,760
this Zone here right the imbalance that

479
00:29:56,760 --> 00:29:58,480
broke the high that that's what it

480
00:29:58,480 --> 00:30:01,320
actually hit in traded higher or if you

481
00:30:01,320 --> 00:30:06,200
just take this the 30% of of the uh uh

482
00:30:06,200 --> 00:30:10,080
30% of the Zone 30% of the down move

483
00:30:10,080 --> 00:30:12,519
right close below that's the protected

484
00:30:12,519 --> 00:30:14,600
High trades up above it but that's a

485
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:17,159
that's a wick right there there are some

486
00:30:17,159 --> 00:30:18,640
times where you're going to get a wick

487
00:30:18,640 --> 00:30:20,399
that will tap back into it and go and

488
00:30:20,399 --> 00:30:22,279
there are other times where you get a

489
00:30:22,279 --> 00:30:25,720
body which one should you use to say

490
00:30:25,720 --> 00:30:28,320
that price is actually flipping to the

491
00:30:28,320 --> 00:30:32,360
upside or flip it to the downside a body

492
00:30:32,360 --> 00:30:35,960
not a wick a body yes the using a body

493
00:30:35,960 --> 00:30:37,480
will cause you to miss out on little

494
00:30:37,480 --> 00:30:39,799
opportunities like this right where you

495
00:30:39,799 --> 00:30:41,399
wanted to wait for the wick you wanted

496
00:30:41,399 --> 00:30:43,200
price to come back and tap you in and

497
00:30:43,200 --> 00:30:46,679
you never got to tap back in the entire

498
00:30:46,679 --> 00:30:49,320
time right you see that you see how

499
00:30:49,320 --> 00:30:52,279
steep this trend line

500
00:30:52,880 --> 00:30:56,480
is where you never got to tap back

501
00:30:56,480 --> 00:30:59,399
in no tap back into no zone or nothing

502
00:30:59,399 --> 00:31:01,200
it's just going going going going going

503
00:31:01,200 --> 00:31:03,720
going going going going going going

504
00:31:03,720 --> 00:31:06,200
going going

505
00:31:10,799 --> 00:31:14,960
going it's just going going going going

506
00:31:14,960 --> 00:31:18,760
and there's no way to get in for

507
00:31:18,880 --> 00:31:20,480
you

508
00:31:20,480 --> 00:31:23,159
right somebody said he exaggerating he

509
00:31:23,159 --> 00:31:25,600
didn't have to do all of that going

510
00:31:25,600 --> 00:31:29,559
somebody WIP in the background

511
00:31:35,159 --> 00:31:38,919
so here we are at at the

512
00:31:38,919 --> 00:31:41,559
4our high that we said we wanted to get

513
00:31:41,559 --> 00:31:43,120
taken it came a lot faster than we

514
00:31:43,120 --> 00:31:46,080
expected right but the 4our

515
00:31:46,080 --> 00:31:48,639
high that that fractal that we wanted to

516
00:31:48,639 --> 00:31:53,240
see taken out right there right so now

517
00:31:53,240 --> 00:31:55,120
here is

518
00:31:55,120 --> 00:31:58,120
where we expect right what do we what do

519
00:31:58,120 --> 00:32:00,399
we usually say in the the the market

520
00:32:00,399 --> 00:32:02,120
reviews I see some people here that are

521
00:32:02,120 --> 00:32:03,880
members of the channel the market

522
00:32:03,880 --> 00:32:05,639
reviews literally tell you guys after

523
00:32:05,639 --> 00:32:07,399
taking at a structural High that's a

524
00:32:07,399 --> 00:32:09,039
structural High to the left even though

525
00:32:09,039 --> 00:32:10,960
it's not a higher high that it's running

526
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:14,039
it's still a structural high it's the

527
00:32:14,039 --> 00:32:16,240
zone that sent price down that's taking

528
00:32:16,240 --> 00:32:20,320
the high out right here so that is

529
00:32:20,320 --> 00:32:22,639
taking a structural high and that's why

530
00:32:22,639 --> 00:32:26,720
you see this move down right this move

531
00:32:26,720 --> 00:32:30,159
down now now the the cites and the bites

532
00:32:30,159 --> 00:32:35,120
are going to say that it's it's is the

533
00:32:35,120 --> 00:32:38,240
imbalance the ciites and the bites they

534
00:32:38,240 --> 00:32:40,519
can say is is the imbalance is the

535
00:32:40,519 --> 00:32:43,720
inversion that it went back into tapped

536
00:32:43,720 --> 00:32:46,519
into to have all that explanation as to

537
00:32:46,519 --> 00:32:49,080
what exactly that is the support and

538
00:32:49,080 --> 00:32:51,399
resistance guys is going to be like well

539
00:32:51,399 --> 00:32:53,760
it's just retesting that previous

540
00:32:53,760 --> 00:32:56,480
resistance and then you have the Quasi

541
00:32:56,480 --> 00:32:59,080
Moto guys who are just like yeah okay it

542
00:32:59,080 --> 00:33:02,279
went there you traded below went back up

543
00:33:02,279 --> 00:33:04,399
traded and when it went down it came

544
00:33:04,399 --> 00:33:06,519
back to test the other side of that and

545
00:33:06,519 --> 00:33:07,960
then the head and shoulders patter are

546
00:33:07,960 --> 00:33:09,679
going to be like yeah is this the head

547
00:33:09,679 --> 00:33:12,080
and shoulders coming up you have all

548
00:33:12,080 --> 00:33:14,960
these different concepts that are in

549
00:33:14,960 --> 00:33:17,320
there

550
00:33:17,320 --> 00:33:20,320
right all these different

551
00:33:20,320 --> 00:33:25,279
concepts that are present inside of why

552
00:33:25,279 --> 00:33:28,600
this rejection here at the top of this

553
00:33:28,600 --> 00:33:30,039
uh Wick is

554
00:33:30,039 --> 00:33:35,120
happening but no real application of how

555
00:33:35,120 --> 00:33:37,080
to trade

556
00:33:37,080 --> 00:33:41,799
it right when to wait for

557
00:33:41,799 --> 00:33:45,279
it you know how how to anticipate the

558
00:33:45,279 --> 00:33:50,200
move coming from there so when we had

559
00:33:50,200 --> 00:33:53,080
mentioned at least wait for it to take

560
00:33:53,080 --> 00:33:55,360
this High because you're in a 4H hour

561
00:33:55,360 --> 00:33:57,279
bullish momentum so you want to see it

562
00:33:57,279 --> 00:34:00,039
at least strip something on the 4 Hour

563
00:34:00,039 --> 00:34:05,559
there's the high and the entry that's in

564
00:34:05,559 --> 00:34:09,320
there clear as

565
00:34:10,800 --> 00:34:14,679
day was the cell

566
00:34:15,399 --> 00:34:17,599
stop and where did we say we're heading

567
00:34:17,599 --> 00:34:21,199
back into some higher time frame

568
00:34:21,199 --> 00:34:23,679
imbalance that's there

569
00:34:23,679 --> 00:34:26,000
right that's what we're going to expect

570
00:34:26,000 --> 00:34:28,719
price to get back to

571
00:34:28,719 --> 00:34:32,040
whenever it it gets up into this area

572
00:34:32,040 --> 00:34:34,599
and begins to uh consolidate we want to

573
00:34:34,599 --> 00:34:36,399
see it come back into a higher time

574
00:34:36,399 --> 00:34:38,719
frame imbalance and it gets that a

575
00:34:38,719 --> 00:34:40,199
higher time frame imbalance and a higher

576
00:34:40,199 --> 00:34:42,760
time frame imbalance stings it back up

577
00:34:42,760 --> 00:34:46,960
into that previous range that it has now

578
00:34:46,960 --> 00:34:49,599
fallen out

579
00:34:50,079 --> 00:34:53,119
of up above the let me move some of this

580
00:34:53,119 --> 00:34:54,639
stuff

581
00:34:54,639 --> 00:34:58,960
out like that

582
00:35:02,640 --> 00:35:05,640
so the the moment to time of

583
00:35:05,640 --> 00:35:08,920
short would never have been

584
00:35:08,920 --> 00:35:11,280
here right especially with our swing

585
00:35:11,280 --> 00:35:13,400
count as we're heading up right it would

586
00:35:13,400 --> 00:35:16,079
have been being that we notice where we

587
00:35:16,079 --> 00:35:19,240
were in the 4our momentum it would be at

588
00:35:19,240 --> 00:35:21,599
a

589
00:35:22,119 --> 00:35:27,800
4our POI or some sort of 4our

590
00:35:27,800 --> 00:35:30,520
area of significance or something like

591
00:35:30,520 --> 00:35:34,560
that that that's you know there to begin

592
00:35:34,560 --> 00:35:38,920
to look for any of that countering this

593
00:35:38,920 --> 00:35:41,839
move up but the problem is people

594
00:35:41,839 --> 00:35:44,480
counter it every single down candle that

595
00:35:44,480 --> 00:35:46,760
that's here oh it got to be going down

596
00:35:46,760 --> 00:35:47,960
here no it got to be going down here no

597
00:35:47,960 --> 00:35:49,200
it got to be going down here you know

598
00:35:49,200 --> 00:35:51,160
what this Market should be going down

599
00:35:51,160 --> 00:35:53,520
because Joe Biden last night was an

600
00:35:53,520 --> 00:35:55,160
embarrassment to

601
00:35:55,160 --> 00:35:58,280
America and you mean to tell me that

602
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,079
there's no confidence in him at all so

603
00:36:01,079 --> 00:36:03,079
this Market should be going down all of

604
00:36:03,079 --> 00:36:05,440
these biases coming in

605
00:36:05,440 --> 00:36:09,280
here as to why the marget should

606
00:36:09,280 --> 00:36:12,319
dump and it comes back to Asia and pumps

607
00:36:12,319 --> 00:36:15,440
the other way what how how far was that

608
00:36:15,440 --> 00:36:19,440
pump because that was

609
00:36:19,440 --> 00:36:25,480
incredible 235 points the other way

610
00:36:37,920 --> 00:36:40,560
so the very first thing you can you can

611
00:36:40,560 --> 00:36:44,000
credit a move like this to is

612
00:36:44,000 --> 00:36:47,880
understanding where your

613
00:36:47,880 --> 00:36:52,000
4our direction is is headed your

614
00:36:52,000 --> 00:36:53,839
4our

615
00:36:53,839 --> 00:36:57,800
U your 4our momentum what what 4our

616
00:36:57,800 --> 00:36:59,400
candle are you

617
00:36:59,400 --> 00:37:04,280
in are you in a 4H hour candle that's

618
00:37:04,280 --> 00:37:07,560
you know looking to create a dogee are

619
00:37:07,560 --> 00:37:10,119
you in a 4-Hour candle that's

620
00:37:10,119 --> 00:37:12,240
expanding with a

621
00:37:12,240 --> 00:37:15,160
body you know what what kind of 4H hour

622
00:37:15,160 --> 00:37:18,319
candle is it now that's determined by

623
00:37:18,319 --> 00:37:22,680
the 4our POI that it Taps into

624
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,440
right so if the 4 Hour is just moving

625
00:37:25,440 --> 00:37:28,720
with momentum You're Expecting body with

626
00:37:28,720 --> 00:37:35,480
semi you know uh uh uh sized Wicks on

627
00:37:35,480 --> 00:37:37,760
smaller sized Wicks on the sides of them

628
00:37:37,760 --> 00:37:39,599
those are just bodies so it's small

629
00:37:39,599 --> 00:37:42,920
Wicks on each side but when it Taps into

630
00:37:42,920 --> 00:37:43,800
its

631
00:37:43,800 --> 00:37:46,440
POI the kind of 4H hour candle that

632
00:37:46,440 --> 00:37:51,200
you're expecting now is not the same you

633
00:37:51,200 --> 00:37:53,520
know manipulate

634
00:37:53,520 --> 00:37:57,680
upward drop downward and then trade back

635
00:37:57,680 --> 00:38:00,160
in like the regular

636
00:38:00,160 --> 00:38:04,359
ohlc um you know that that we often see

637
00:38:04,359 --> 00:38:06,680
now you're looking

638
00:38:06,680 --> 00:38:10,160
for the either the the

639
00:38:10,160 --> 00:38:15,359
dogee or the flat candle that has a wick

640
00:38:15,359 --> 00:38:17,839
at the bottom of it that runs back the

641
00:38:17,839 --> 00:38:18,960
other

642
00:38:18,960 --> 00:38:21,920
way so if you know the orientation of

643
00:38:21,920 --> 00:38:23,599
that candle where's the open of the flat

644
00:38:23,599 --> 00:38:25,440
candle at the top right what does it

645
00:38:25,440 --> 00:38:27,800
just do dump

646
00:38:27,800 --> 00:38:30,720
and then what happens it closes with the

647
00:38:30,720 --> 00:38:32,280
wick at the bottom and what does the

648
00:38:32,280 --> 00:38:35,079
next candle do pump to the to the the

649
00:38:35,079 --> 00:38:37,599
flat surface that was left up

650
00:38:37,599 --> 00:38:40,920
there those things often happen

651
00:38:40,920 --> 00:38:44,560
in uh London overnight where we have

652
00:38:44,560 --> 00:38:47,400
this Asia dump followed by this hellish

653
00:38:47,400 --> 00:38:51,760
pump in in uh uh New

654
00:38:52,359 --> 00:38:56,240
York so when when we have those things

655
00:38:56,240 --> 00:38:59,160
if you know how the candle closes based

656
00:38:59,160 --> 00:39:02,760
on the POI that it's in then you trade

657
00:39:02,760 --> 00:39:04,680
in the

658
00:39:04,680 --> 00:39:08,680
direction you trade in the direction of

659
00:39:08,680 --> 00:39:12,880
the kind of candle you know price is

660
00:39:12,880 --> 00:39:16,280
forming is it a reversal candle that's

661
00:39:16,280 --> 00:39:18,480
those pin bars morning Stars whatever it

662
00:39:18,480 --> 00:39:21,400
is they want to call it you know the the

663
00:39:21,400 --> 00:39:23,440
well that's getting into bars you know I

664
00:39:23,440 --> 00:39:25,720
really don't want to go you know too

665
00:39:25,720 --> 00:39:27,440
deep into that because you guys still

666
00:39:27,440 --> 00:39:30,119
need to understand structure right but

667
00:39:30,119 --> 00:39:32,880
when you get into understanding the bars

668
00:39:32,880 --> 00:39:36,319
you could predict the entire day based

669
00:39:36,319 --> 00:39:39,520
on the POI that it's in you can know

670
00:39:39,520 --> 00:39:42,359
whether today is going to be a a range

671
00:39:42,359 --> 00:39:45,200
Day based on the POI and based on the

672
00:39:45,200 --> 00:39:47,079
kind of candle that comes out of that

673
00:39:47,079 --> 00:39:50,240
POI all ad doe is is a range and traded

674
00:39:50,240 --> 00:39:52,200
up above trade it down below and came

675
00:39:52,200 --> 00:39:55,240
right back to the center point of it so

676
00:39:55,240 --> 00:39:57,480
now you know the market moves up and and

677
00:39:57,480 --> 00:39:59,160
then it goes down below and then it

678
00:39:59,160 --> 00:40:00,920
comes back to the center of it and you

679
00:40:00,920 --> 00:40:03,560
know to trade either extremes I'm going

680
00:40:03,560 --> 00:40:04,920
trade the high of the dogee then it

681
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:06,520
drops back down and puts in the low

682
00:40:06,520 --> 00:40:08,000
right oror trade the low of it and it

683
00:40:08,000 --> 00:40:09,640
trades back to the center right so

684
00:40:09,640 --> 00:40:12,480
that's how you know you're in a I

685
00:40:12,480 --> 00:40:15,800
mean let me not go too too far

686
00:40:15,800 --> 00:40:19,440
into into

687
00:40:19,440 --> 00:40:23,680
um you know sort of the the the detail

688
00:40:23,680 --> 00:40:27,960
specific things of of bars candlesticks

689
00:40:27,960 --> 00:40:30,960
but um you come into the market and just

690
00:40:30,960 --> 00:40:33,079
do the same thing every

691
00:40:33,079 --> 00:40:35,160
day and when you come into that and do

692
00:40:35,160 --> 00:40:38,280
the same thing every day you know it

693
00:40:38,280 --> 00:40:42,680
it's it's a glorious

694
00:40:42,880 --> 00:40:46,480
thing it's glorious feeling so this is

695
00:40:46,480 --> 00:40:49,440
the this is the first imbalance right

696
00:40:49,440 --> 00:40:52,160
that's down here right so let me

697
00:40:52,160 --> 00:40:54,680
actually just double check uh what

698
00:40:54,680 --> 00:40:56,640
imbalance that is it's the five minute

699
00:40:56,640 --> 00:40:59,240
imbalance

700
00:40:59,240 --> 00:41:02,119
uh let me

701
00:41:02,400 --> 00:41:07,240
see 12 minute imbalance is

702
00:41:25,880 --> 00:41:30,960
here okay so we're in this fractal right

703
00:41:31,599 --> 00:41:35,280
now 12 minute

704
00:41:36,560 --> 00:41:40,160
fractal this right here I would

705
00:41:40,160 --> 00:41:41,680
anticipate

706
00:41:41,680 --> 00:41:46,280
price to when it looks for this low move

707
00:41:46,280 --> 00:41:51,040
back into that high there so um I'm

708
00:41:51,040 --> 00:41:53,680
still expecting this high up above here

709
00:41:53,680 --> 00:41:55,319
to be taken

710
00:41:55,319 --> 00:41:58,280
out um but a lot of this times it's is

711
00:41:58,280 --> 00:42:00,920
just when you know uh we could hit this

712
00:42:00,920 --> 00:42:02,560
fractal here you see we already hit the

713
00:42:02,560 --> 00:42:04,599
30% and started curling at it we could

714
00:42:04,599 --> 00:42:06,319
hit this fractal here this is 12 minute

715
00:42:06,319 --> 00:42:09,200
fractal and trade back into the high or

716
00:42:09,200 --> 00:42:10,640
the possibility of the low of the

717
00:42:10,640 --> 00:42:12,920
fractal going and then going back for

718
00:42:12,920 --> 00:42:17,520
the high it's just you know whichever

719
00:42:17,520 --> 00:42:21,839
um whichever one that that

720
00:42:21,839 --> 00:42:25,240
uh they choose to do would be all based

721
00:42:25,240 --> 00:42:27,319
on

722
00:42:27,319 --> 00:42:30,800
structure right will be all based on

723
00:42:30,800 --> 00:42:34,720
what we have uh within

724
00:42:34,720 --> 00:42:38,319
here so we know we have this let me move

725
00:42:38,319 --> 00:42:40,839
this

726
00:42:41,079 --> 00:42:45,200
to to the side we know we have this Wick

727
00:42:45,200 --> 00:42:47,079
price ultimately might look for the low

728
00:42:47,079 --> 00:42:49,520
of it so you might get like a little tap

729
00:42:49,520 --> 00:42:52,839
down into here at 30 230 and it could

730
00:42:52,839 --> 00:42:55,280
bring you back up to if it leaves this

731
00:42:55,280 --> 00:42:58,160
Wick at 44 it could bring you back up to

732
00:42:58,160 --> 00:43:02,640
44 um but

733
00:43:03,280 --> 00:43:06,359
we're here and we're still anticipating

734
00:43:06,359 --> 00:43:09,240
this High

735
00:43:11,040 --> 00:43:15,760
here to be taken out

736
00:43:37,599 --> 00:43:40,599
okay

737
00:43:41,599 --> 00:43:44,520
yeah so this that

738
00:43:44,520 --> 00:43:48,079
um uh 50% tap the one to one delivery is

739
00:43:48,079 --> 00:43:50,839
above this high this Wick High here I

740
00:43:50,839 --> 00:43:52,480
thought it would have dropped into here

741
00:43:52,480 --> 00:43:57,359
and then went back to this uh Wick High

742
00:43:57,359 --> 00:44:00,559
22 and then back

743
00:44:00,599 --> 00:44:04,440
to 44 and

744
00:44:05,559 --> 00:44:07,359
47

745
00:44:07,359 --> 00:44:10,839
but looks like it's responding out of

746
00:44:10,839 --> 00:44:15,440
this POI here this Wick

747
00:44:26,040 --> 00:44:30,079
here e

748
00:45:12,559 --> 00:45:16,119
I don't know if it quite took it let

749
00:45:18,839 --> 00:45:23,839
me oh no I didn't take it yet

750
00:45:31,240 --> 00:45:34,720
so this is back into the wick a second

751
00:45:34,720 --> 00:45:37,720
time

752
00:45:45,079 --> 00:45:48,000
um we have 10:30 here so remember what

753
00:45:48,000 --> 00:45:51,079
we say about 10:30 with 10:30 there's a

754
00:45:51,079 --> 00:45:56,480
possibility of um

755
00:45:57,040 --> 00:45:58,520
depending on the direction that it's

756
00:45:58,520 --> 00:46:02,599
going in um they could be one more high

757
00:46:02,599 --> 00:46:07,400
or one more low after 10:30

758
00:46:11,359 --> 00:46:14,119
so large candle going in you just want

759
00:46:14,119 --> 00:46:18,680
to be mindful of this you're not uh

760
00:46:18,680 --> 00:46:21,119
using something like that remember what

761
00:46:21,119 --> 00:46:23,119
we're ultimately looking for is the

762
00:46:23,119 --> 00:46:26,119
sweep below here right and then the move

763
00:46:26,119 --> 00:46:27,680
back into the ring

764
00:46:27,680 --> 00:46:29,200
there because this is a higher time

765
00:46:29,200 --> 00:46:30,720
frame

766
00:46:30,720 --> 00:46:33,800
imbalance that we're in right here so

767
00:46:33,800 --> 00:46:37,119
just trail that down candle high and

768
00:46:37,119 --> 00:46:40,760
then you'd have some idea of when to go

769
00:46:40,760 --> 00:46:44,359
back into the range

770
00:47:19,440 --> 00:47:20,960
the

771
00:47:20,960 --> 00:47:24,480
momentum looking at

772
00:47:25,359 --> 00:47:27,880
it if it can contines it could be

773
00:47:27,880 --> 00:47:31,680
looking to get back to

774
00:47:32,480 --> 00:47:36,000
this High

775
00:47:39,640 --> 00:47:44,200
here at 47

776
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:07,880
probably thinking that 55 high too

777
00:48:08,000 --> 00:48:12,359
but I don't know

778
00:48:13,160 --> 00:48:16,559
um mic is super

779
00:48:16,559 --> 00:48:19,400
low uh why the 12 minute that's just

780
00:48:19,400 --> 00:48:22,720
something that I with back testing I saw

781
00:48:22,720 --> 00:48:25,240
for myself it worked and then that's

782
00:48:25,240 --> 00:48:27,839
something that I started to teach

783
00:48:27,839 --> 00:48:29,839
most people who learn from me you'll

784
00:48:29,839 --> 00:48:32,079
hear them using the 12 minute the 144

785
00:48:32,079 --> 00:48:34,520
minute that's you know one of those time

786
00:48:34,520 --> 00:48:36,920
frames that you're going to know yeah

787
00:48:36,920 --> 00:48:41,200
that person you know just uses it from

788
00:48:41,200 --> 00:48:44,319
from this particular concept but it's

789
00:48:44,319 --> 00:48:47,000
just a lot easier to to see that way

790
00:48:47,000 --> 00:48:49,839
it's like a rule of rule of 12 almost

791
00:48:49,839 --> 00:48:55,799
you know um it's 12 5c candles that make

792
00:48:55,799 --> 00:48:58,680
up the one minute time

793
00:48:58,680 --> 00:49:02,240
frame it's 12 one minute candles that

794
00:49:02,240 --> 00:49:07,040
make up the 12 minute time frame it's 12

795
00:49:07,040 --> 00:49:10,599
12 minute candles that make up the 144

796
00:49:10,599 --> 00:49:12,760
minute time frame now you don't you

797
00:49:12,760 --> 00:49:14,559
don't necessarily have to use that you

798
00:49:14,559 --> 00:49:17,079
could use some other variation of of

799
00:49:17,079 --> 00:49:19,040
whatever higher time frame to lower time

800
00:49:19,040 --> 00:49:21,520
frame you like to look at but for me I

801
00:49:21,520 --> 00:49:25,920
know that um I see the clearest with

802
00:49:25,920 --> 00:49:28,559
those time frames frames that's it is is

803
00:49:28,559 --> 00:49:31,960
a a fractal way of of viewing price you

804
00:49:31,960 --> 00:49:33,720
got to think about it so look at this

805
00:49:33,720 --> 00:49:35,240
look at this let me let me just show you

806
00:49:35,240 --> 00:49:37,599
this real

807
00:49:37,599 --> 00:49:40,599
quick

808
00:49:40,799 --> 00:49:44,280
so if I wanted to

809
00:49:44,280 --> 00:49:47,920
see I don't know something in here let's

810
00:49:47,920 --> 00:49:50,839
say in order to take a trade I need it

811
00:49:50,839 --> 00:49:53,520
to see a pullback into an imbalance

812
00:49:53,520 --> 00:49:56,400
before taking a continuation trade right

813
00:49:56,400 --> 00:49:59,640
here right and we have this high that

814
00:49:59,640 --> 00:50:02,920
was taken out right

815
00:50:02,920 --> 00:50:06,559
here I should be able to go to some time

816
00:50:06,559 --> 00:50:11,319
frame and find the imbalance within here

817
00:50:11,319 --> 00:50:14,440
right if I like to take entries off of

818
00:50:14,440 --> 00:50:16,640
those fresh imbalances that that put in

819
00:50:16,640 --> 00:50:19,839
new highs so I don't know exactly oh I

820
00:50:19,839 --> 00:50:21,760
didn't realize we were on a 30 second my

821
00:50:21,760 --> 00:50:23,440
bad

822
00:50:23,440 --> 00:50:27,760
um you know let's go into

823
00:50:27,760 --> 00:50:31,760
something within here there's the one

824
00:50:31,760 --> 00:50:32,799
there we

825
00:50:32,799 --> 00:50:37,960
go so now that same imbalance let me

826
00:50:37,960 --> 00:50:43,040
um just uh move some of this stuff up

827
00:50:43,040 --> 00:50:46,280
here now that same Zone that I used

828
00:50:46,280 --> 00:50:47,720
below

829
00:50:47,720 --> 00:50:51,599
right on the 4our time frame it was an

830
00:50:51,599 --> 00:50:54,960
imbalance so this is tapping

831
00:50:54,960 --> 00:50:57,040
into the first imbalance balance that

832
00:50:57,040 --> 00:51:01,240
puts in a new high right here

833
00:51:01,240 --> 00:51:05,240
right so the 4our time frame showed the

834
00:51:05,240 --> 00:51:06,440
imbalance

835
00:51:06,440 --> 00:51:10,040
there but any other time frame below it

836
00:51:10,040 --> 00:51:12,280
one minute showed snd responsible for

837
00:51:12,280 --> 00:51:12,960
the

838
00:51:12,960 --> 00:51:16,319
break 15 minute uh same thing that's the

839
00:51:16,319 --> 00:51:17,359
responsible for the break with an

840
00:51:17,359 --> 00:51:19,680
imbalance right in the center of

841
00:51:19,680 --> 00:51:22,960
it 12 minute when there's two imbalances

842
00:51:22,960 --> 00:51:24,200
inside of it you want need to second one

843
00:51:24,200 --> 00:51:25,359
another first one that's something

844
00:51:25,359 --> 00:51:27,839
teaching the mentorship five minute you

845
00:51:27,839 --> 00:51:29,839
have a sweep of a zone right up above

846
00:51:29,839 --> 00:51:33,400
and and price Taps into you TR High

847
00:51:33,400 --> 00:51:35,680
there's fractally you go all the way

848
00:51:35,680 --> 00:51:38,000
back there is whatever it is that you

849
00:51:38,000 --> 00:51:44,400
need to see right to take an entry

850
00:51:44,400 --> 00:51:48,440
within you know that that POI that price

851
00:51:48,440 --> 00:51:52,079
is leaving leaving from but you can go

852
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:56,160
to um you know the the the 4 minute you

853
00:51:56,160 --> 00:51:59,920
can go to the uh I don't know you got

854
00:51:59,920 --> 00:52:03,400
any 11th Hour Traders you you 11th Hour

855
00:52:03,400 --> 00:52:05,559
you know whatever it is look at this

856
00:52:05,559 --> 00:52:08,839
look at this beautiful the 11th Hour

857
00:52:08,839 --> 00:52:11,000
woke up at 500

858
00:52:11,000 --> 00:52:14,799
a.m. tapped into that first imbalance ye

859
00:52:14,799 --> 00:52:17,160
went to go run and put in a new high now

860
00:52:17,160 --> 00:52:19,880
there an 11th Hour up candle that's up

861
00:52:19,880 --> 00:52:22,839
here right right there will beat right

862
00:52:22,839 --> 00:52:26,240
at that time

863
00:52:27,440 --> 00:52:30,280
that we could have Justified a a tap in

864
00:52:30,280 --> 00:52:31,960
there for you know like there's there's

865
00:52:31,960 --> 00:52:34,280
a you can go to whatever time frame go

866
00:52:34,280 --> 00:52:35,880
to I don't

867
00:52:35,880 --> 00:52:37,440
know

868
00:52:37,440 --> 00:52:41,040
uh three day maybe now we're in a

869
00:52:41,040 --> 00:52:43,280
three-day Wick hey whoa look at that

870
00:52:43,280 --> 00:52:46,160
y'all we we ta to a three-day

871
00:52:46,160 --> 00:52:48,920
Wick no wonder there was some heavy

872
00:52:48,920 --> 00:52:51,200
momentum coming out of there you know

873
00:52:51,200 --> 00:52:55,280
you go to you know I don't know two two

874
00:52:55,280 --> 00:52:58,440
weeks maybe

875
00:53:01,000 --> 00:53:03,760
even so this looks like they this looks

876
00:53:03,760 --> 00:53:04,760
like they're going

877
00:53:04,760 --> 00:53:08,799
to um seek to put in a new high maybe

878
00:53:08,799 --> 00:53:10,359
drop back below there this could

879
00:53:10,359 --> 00:53:12,920
actually be a dogee over the next two

880
00:53:12,920 --> 00:53:16,960
weeks up in here up above here the

881
00:53:16,960 --> 00:53:19,319
following two weeks tap into there

882
00:53:19,319 --> 00:53:21,160
another two weeks down maybe hit that

883
00:53:21,160 --> 00:53:23,079
fresh and balance following two weeks

884
00:53:23,079 --> 00:53:25,160
after that go back up putting a new high

885
00:53:25,160 --> 00:53:27,880
up above there you find it on any time

886
00:53:27,880 --> 00:53:30,520
frame the thing you love to trade the

887
00:53:30,520 --> 00:53:32,599
thing you love to be able to execute on

888
00:53:32,599 --> 00:53:35,559
you can find it on any time

889
00:53:35,559 --> 00:53:39,280
frame and trade it but you first have to

890
00:53:39,280 --> 00:53:41,920
understand how price moves

891
00:53:41,920 --> 00:53:44,280
first then you go to the time frame in

892
00:53:44,280 --> 00:53:46,599
which you want to see this particular

893
00:53:46,599 --> 00:53:50,799
thing you know um play

894
00:53:53,079 --> 00:53:56,200
out so look at that bang nice little you

895
00:53:56,200 --> 00:54:01,000
know buy stop right here that would have

896
00:54:01,000 --> 00:54:03,400
ran to this this high at

897
00:54:03,400 --> 00:54:05,599
47 I

898
00:54:05,599 --> 00:54:08,640
was I was thinking more of the 55 but

899
00:54:08,640 --> 00:54:12,280
you know whatever you

900
00:54:12,559 --> 00:54:16,760
know I I just I just suck at this that's

901
00:54:16,760 --> 00:54:19,400
really what it

902
00:54:19,520 --> 00:54:22,520
is seven points seven seven points I was

903
00:54:22,520 --> 00:54:26,240
wrong about seven points

904
00:54:34,280 --> 00:54:38,400
so now you see us digging further into

905
00:54:38,400 --> 00:54:40,359
that imbalance here but but pay

906
00:54:40,359 --> 00:54:42,599
attention to the highs that we have here

907
00:54:42,599 --> 00:54:44,720
so we have that one here right we have

908
00:54:44,720 --> 00:54:46,520
this one here right we have that one

909
00:54:46,520 --> 00:54:49,280
there right they all belong to to uh

910
00:54:49,280 --> 00:54:53,640
lows right there a third low there right

911
00:54:53,640 --> 00:54:59,079
so this is a third thir low digging into

912
00:54:59,079 --> 00:54:59,839
an

913
00:54:59,839 --> 00:55:02,680
imbalance we can move back up into that

914
00:55:02,680 --> 00:55:05,280
direction there and trade out but if we

915
00:55:05,280 --> 00:55:09,240
end up failing to put in that new low

916
00:55:09,240 --> 00:55:13,000
down here you know that this

917
00:55:13,119 --> 00:55:17,000
high is what they're looking

918
00:55:17,599 --> 00:55:20,359
for so it's all about timing you can

919
00:55:20,359 --> 00:55:22,119
time entries going back into the range

920
00:55:22,119 --> 00:55:24,880
perfectly yes you can time entries

921
00:55:24,880 --> 00:55:27,640
trading back into the the previous range

922
00:55:27,640 --> 00:55:29,400
During certain periods of uh

923
00:55:29,400 --> 00:55:31,240
consolidation that you

924
00:55:31,240 --> 00:55:33,400
anticipate we mentioned that we were to

925
00:55:33,400 --> 00:55:35,680
anticipate consolidation

926
00:55:35,680 --> 00:55:38,640
why because we took out something

927
00:55:38,640 --> 00:55:41,400
structural to the

928
00:55:41,640 --> 00:55:44,240
left so if we understand that that we

929
00:55:44,240 --> 00:55:45,640
took out something structural to the

930
00:55:45,640 --> 00:55:47,520
left and we know that consolidation is

931
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,359
getting ready to um occur now we want to

932
00:55:50,359 --> 00:55:51,760
look at the boundaries of our

933
00:55:51,760 --> 00:55:53,720
consolidation the boundaries of our

934
00:55:53,720 --> 00:55:56,280
consolidation is between that higher

935
00:55:56,280 --> 00:55:58,680
time from imbalance that's below right

936
00:55:58,680 --> 00:56:01,480
and then the wick that it left up above

937
00:56:01,480 --> 00:56:04,319
if it's the first Wick there then that's

938
00:56:04,319 --> 00:56:06,359
toilet paper people right inducement

939
00:56:06,359 --> 00:56:08,960
whatever you want to call it the second

940
00:56:08,960 --> 00:56:12,839
Wick up there now that could very well

941
00:56:12,839 --> 00:56:15,920
be sent in the market lower after that

942
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:18,079
consolidation that happens with the

943
00:56:18,079 --> 00:56:20,839
second High that's put in but whenever

944
00:56:20,839 --> 00:56:23,079
we have that first high after taking out

945
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:25,039
something to the left and we have this

946
00:56:25,039 --> 00:56:27,440
imbalance below we know that there's

947
00:56:27,440 --> 00:56:29,359
consolidation up here because a higher

948
00:56:29,359 --> 00:56:32,240
time frame dogee occurs up here right

949
00:56:32,240 --> 00:56:36,920
and then the next hour's time frame Taps

950
00:56:36,920 --> 00:56:41,599
into the the uh uh imbalance below right

951
00:56:41,599 --> 00:56:43,799
and then the following hour that that

952
00:56:43,799 --> 00:56:46,200
one hour can move its like you squeeze

953
00:56:46,200 --> 00:56:49,160
its way up but the following hour now is

954
00:56:49,160 --> 00:56:52,480
the candle that pushes out of it so you

955
00:56:52,480 --> 00:56:56,200
have to be able to um you know follow

956
00:56:56,200 --> 00:56:58,319
follow them that way follow

957
00:56:58,319 --> 00:57:01,760
consolidation that way and I think that

958
00:57:01,760 --> 00:57:03,599
um that's something that that could

959
00:57:03,599 --> 00:57:05,839
certainly uh

960
00:57:05,839 --> 00:57:09,240
improve a lot of your your trading or or

961
00:57:09,240 --> 00:57:11,599
just like the the whole fomo

962
00:57:11,599 --> 00:57:14,319
aspect you know we know that there are

963
00:57:14,319 --> 00:57:17,960
times where uh we are early we

964
00:57:17,960 --> 00:57:20,200
understand that so if we understand that

965
00:57:20,200 --> 00:57:22,799
there are times where we are early then

966
00:57:22,799 --> 00:57:24,599
we need to start

967
00:57:24,599 --> 00:57:27,079
trading right we need start trading with

968
00:57:27,079 --> 00:57:29,640
the understanding that we could possibly

969
00:57:29,640 --> 00:57:31,680
be

970
00:57:31,680 --> 00:57:35,119
early so if you could possibly be early

971
00:57:35,119 --> 00:57:37,799
then the size that you're going in with

972
00:57:37,799 --> 00:57:39,839
you need to know is not the proper size

973
00:57:39,839 --> 00:57:43,160
to to be going in with the areas that

974
00:57:43,160 --> 00:57:46,599
you're you're um targeting you need to

975
00:57:46,599 --> 00:57:48,760
know that maybe that's not something you

976
00:57:48,760 --> 00:57:52,480
should be targeting on the initial

977
00:57:52,480 --> 00:57:56,720
entry your initial entry should Target

978
00:57:56,720 --> 00:58:00,359
your confirmation for bullish

979
00:58:00,359 --> 00:58:02,839
momentum right or your confirmation for

980
00:58:02,839 --> 00:58:06,920
bearish momentum so what I mean by that

981
00:58:06,920 --> 00:58:11,799
is if we trade in this Zone

982
00:58:15,400 --> 00:58:18,559
here if we are trading in inside of the

983
00:58:18,559 --> 00:58:20,680
the previous range of this Zone

984
00:58:20,680 --> 00:58:23,359
here

985
00:58:23,359 --> 00:58:27,559
and you see us tap into the zone

986
00:58:27,559 --> 00:58:30,960
from down below here

987
00:58:30,960 --> 00:58:33,680
right this is the

988
00:58:33,680 --> 00:58:37,599
manipulation that happened here this is

989
00:58:37,599 --> 00:58:41,400
the break right of that previous

990
00:58:41,400 --> 00:58:44,240
protected high that we have over there

991
00:58:44,240 --> 00:58:46,599
bam we took it out right there I thought

992
00:58:46,599 --> 00:58:48,920
this was with a oh this is a body

993
00:58:48,920 --> 00:58:51,280
because of the 30 second time frame okay

994
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:55,160
so this this is with with the body here

995
00:58:55,160 --> 00:58:58,680
we go and trade back into the zone right

996
00:58:58,680 --> 00:59:02,039
here right to Now find that confirmation

997
00:59:02,039 --> 00:59:03,599
to trade

998
00:59:03,599 --> 00:59:07,359
higher so if your entry is here your

999
00:59:07,359 --> 00:59:11,280
target is the confirmation to send us

1000
00:59:11,280 --> 00:59:12,839
bullish

1001
00:59:12,839 --> 00:59:15,400
because price often times is going to

1002
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:19,160
get to that previous candle's high but

1003
00:59:19,160 --> 00:59:22,920
if there's no strong close above it no

1004
00:59:22,920 --> 00:59:26,480
body close above it then what you end up

1005
00:59:26,480 --> 00:59:32,559
having is uh uh we hit that Target yeah

1006
00:59:32,559 --> 00:59:36,559
and then we trade lower like that right

1007
00:59:36,559 --> 00:59:40,160
but if this is your Target and then your

1008
00:59:40,160 --> 00:59:42,559
other Target what you're thinking about

1009
00:59:42,559 --> 00:59:45,240
is potentially here right maybe this

1010
00:59:45,240 --> 00:59:47,839
high right here or or maybe even

1011
00:59:47,839 --> 00:59:50,720
something within here right if you're in

1012
00:59:50,720 --> 00:59:52,520
on this entry you need to know that

1013
00:59:52,520 --> 00:59:54,559
price can come back and retest that

1014
00:59:54,559 --> 00:59:56,559
entry so

1015
00:59:56,559 --> 00:59:58,640
that entry there and that Target there

1016
00:59:58,640 --> 01:00:01,480
is a great Target to have now should it

1017
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:05,200
want to trade higher you Trail

1018
01:00:05,200 --> 01:00:07,720
below we just changed the color for this

1019
01:00:07,720 --> 01:00:12,240
you Trail below these down candle lows

1020
01:00:12,240 --> 01:00:15,240
or these down swing lows you're trading

1021
01:00:15,240 --> 01:00:17,839
below that below that there as it's

1022
01:00:17,839 --> 01:00:20,440
continuing to make its way up below that

1023
01:00:20,440 --> 01:00:22,599
swing up there below that one there

1024
01:00:22,599 --> 01:00:24,400
below that one there below that one

1025
01:00:24,400 --> 01:00:27,720
there until price finally moves you out

1026
01:00:27,720 --> 01:00:29,599
of that

1027
01:00:29,599 --> 01:00:33,559
position but it has to start here in the

1028
01:00:33,559 --> 01:00:35,920
center of the Zone it has to start in in

1029
01:00:35,920 --> 01:00:38,520
the zone itself and then that allows you

1030
01:00:38,520 --> 01:00:41,000
to manage the problem is some people get

1031
01:00:41,000 --> 01:00:43,640
a tap into the Zone here right and

1032
01:00:43,640 --> 01:00:46,039
because they don't trust it they see

1033
01:00:46,039 --> 01:00:48,720
price get here and now this is where

1034
01:00:48,720 --> 01:00:52,039
they want to get involved there but when

1035
01:00:52,039 --> 01:00:54,720
price already delivers that one to one

1036
01:00:54,720 --> 01:00:57,079
and drops back the other way to now go

1037
01:00:57,079 --> 01:01:00,799
and take that low they get caught in

1038
01:01:00,799 --> 01:01:03,160
having to risk that whole Zone and eat

1039
01:01:03,160 --> 01:01:06,160
that entire risk

1040
01:01:06,160 --> 01:01:09,599
versus just using

1041
01:01:09,599 --> 01:01:12,319
zones that align with the things that

1042
01:01:12,319 --> 01:01:15,240
they are successful with in back testing

1043
01:01:15,240 --> 01:01:17,240
so I see my zone I see my flip in the

1044
01:01:17,240 --> 01:01:19,039
zone I Target the one to one there

1045
01:01:19,039 --> 01:01:20,680
should I want to trade higher there I

1046
01:01:20,680 --> 01:01:23,039
would find a re-entry somewhere within

1047
01:01:23,039 --> 01:01:26,079
here to potentially go higher there and

1048
01:01:26,079 --> 01:01:27,400
then that's where I'm out and that's

1049
01:01:27,400 --> 01:01:28,480
where I'm

1050
01:01:28,480 --> 01:01:30,799
done right so what did I say we were

1051
01:01:30,799 --> 01:01:32,200
going to have I said we were going to

1052
01:01:32,200 --> 01:01:36,200
have a tap back into the imbalance right

1053
01:01:36,200 --> 01:01:39,400
and then potentially a new high being

1054
01:01:39,400 --> 01:01:40,640
put in up

1055
01:01:40,640 --> 01:01:43,599
above right so if we have a tap into

1056
01:01:43,599 --> 01:01:45,280
that imbalance and a new high being put

1057
01:01:45,280 --> 01:01:46,920
in up

1058
01:01:46,920 --> 01:01:51,240
above then that means that when that new

1059
01:01:51,240 --> 01:01:55,319
high is established up above now I'm

1060
01:01:55,319 --> 01:01:58,240
looking to short back

1061
01:01:58,240 --> 01:02:01,559
into that range that's there now that's

1062
01:02:01,559 --> 01:02:04,319
if price provides me with that

1063
01:02:04,319 --> 01:02:07,799
opportunity to trade higher right if

1064
01:02:07,799 --> 01:02:10,079
it's not going to trade higher I know

1065
01:02:10,079 --> 01:02:12,640
that my opportunity to short I mean

1066
01:02:12,640 --> 01:02:15,119
sorry to Long

1067
01:02:15,119 --> 01:02:17,680
exist down in these

1068
01:02:17,680 --> 01:02:22,079
lows exist down in this Zone that we

1069
01:02:22,079 --> 01:02:24,640
have here left behind exist after

1070
01:02:24,640 --> 01:02:26,880
potentially some sweep you know stuff

1071
01:02:26,880 --> 01:02:30,200
like that I know that's where it

1072
01:02:30,200 --> 01:02:33,920
exists and anything within here is still

1073
01:02:33,920 --> 01:02:35,960
tied into this being the top of the

1074
01:02:35,960 --> 01:02:38,079
range and this over this element over

1075
01:02:38,079 --> 01:02:40,119
here being the bottom of the range

1076
01:02:40,119 --> 01:02:42,520
within

1077
01:02:42,920 --> 01:02:47,000
there so if I was in an entry and had

1078
01:02:47,000 --> 01:02:49,359
any internal targets it would just be

1079
01:02:49,359 --> 01:02:51,400
because I would be trading

1080
01:02:51,400 --> 01:02:53,880
this consolidation that I was

1081
01:02:53,880 --> 01:02:56,400
anticipating after this structure high

1082
01:02:56,400 --> 01:02:59,319
was taken to the

1083
01:03:00,680 --> 01:03:04,599
left and that's how we

1084
01:03:05,960 --> 01:03:09,319
have our

1085
01:03:13,680 --> 01:03:18,520
nft look at that that's

1086
01:03:20,440 --> 01:03:24,960
perfect there we go nft

1087
01:03:27,039 --> 01:03:29,680
but none nonetheless nonetheless let's

1088
01:03:29,680 --> 01:03:31,720
let's let's bring it in because you know

1089
01:03:31,720 --> 01:03:35,839
how you guys get um this the perfecting

1090
01:03:35,839 --> 01:03:39,680
now okay okay we we going relax we we

1091
01:03:39,680 --> 01:03:42,520
won't

1092
01:03:43,079 --> 01:03:46,960
we we won't

1093
01:03:47,640 --> 01:03:53,279
uh we won't go too far in today's stream

1094
01:03:56,920 --> 01:03:59,440
uh so

1095
01:03:59,440 --> 01:04:02,160
um uh

1096
01:04:02,160 --> 01:04:07,599
uh if you can get the um uh that

1097
01:04:07,599 --> 01:04:09,960
narrative that I just gave entire

1098
01:04:09,960 --> 01:04:11,920
narrative that I just gave from the 4

1099
01:04:11,920 --> 01:04:13,920
Hour to down to the time frame we're at

1100
01:04:13,920 --> 01:04:16,160
to down to why we expecting the range to

1101
01:04:16,160 --> 01:04:18,599
down to what we you know Target within

1102
01:04:18,599 --> 01:04:21,000
that range to down to you like all of

1103
01:04:21,000 --> 01:04:23,720
that stuff in there

1104
01:04:23,720 --> 01:04:26,839
um if you truly understand the fractal

1105
01:04:26,839 --> 01:04:28,880
nature of price and if you truly have

1106
01:04:28,880 --> 01:04:31,319
gone through the

1107
01:04:31,319 --> 01:04:34,359
material then you would hear what I just

1108
01:04:34,359 --> 01:04:36,720
said and you'd be able to grab it with

1109
01:04:36,720 --> 01:04:39,160
with no issue you'd be able to

1110
01:04:39,160 --> 01:04:40,119
understand that you'd be able to take

1111
01:04:40,119 --> 01:04:42,119
notes and you'd be able to back test

1112
01:04:42,119 --> 01:04:45,440
each part right because I I explained

1113
01:04:45,440 --> 01:04:48,039
many different parts just now you'd be

1114
01:04:48,039 --> 01:04:50,720
able to Gras each

1115
01:04:50,720 --> 01:04:56,520
part right each part of what I said

1116
01:04:56,520 --> 01:04:58,920
and um I think

1117
01:04:58,920 --> 01:05:02,359
that uh that that would help with that

1118
01:05:02,359 --> 01:05:06,559
whole um how to determine daily bias

1119
01:05:06,559 --> 01:05:08,880
question like you know how to determine

1120
01:05:08,880 --> 01:05:11,839
session bias how to you all all of that

1121
01:05:11,839 --> 01:05:13,640
stuff you don't need to determine any of

1122
01:05:13,640 --> 01:05:16,440
that it's not your business it's not

1123
01:05:16,440 --> 01:05:18,839
your business at all to determine you

1124
01:05:18,839 --> 01:05:21,599
know what price is going to do for the

1125
01:05:21,599 --> 01:05:24,559
day right when you're looking for an

1126
01:05:24,559 --> 01:05:26,279
entry it's your business to know where

1127
01:05:26,279 --> 01:05:28,039
price is

1128
01:05:28,039 --> 01:05:30,680
going when you are looking for your

1129
01:05:30,680 --> 01:05:32,960
entry there's the only thing that you're

1130
01:05:32,960 --> 01:05:34,319
concerned about that's the only thing

1131
01:05:34,319 --> 01:05:36,279
that you are worried about you do not

1132
01:05:36,279 --> 01:05:39,720
care where Terminus for the day is it

1133
01:05:39,720 --> 01:05:42,640
does not matter to

1134
01:05:46,000 --> 01:05:50,279
you so um take that little part that I

1135
01:05:50,279 --> 01:05:53,799
just gave youall the little small uh

1136
01:05:53,799 --> 01:05:57,720
excerpt there and uh um you know digest

1137
01:05:57,720 --> 01:06:00,599
it I think that um it would

1138
01:06:00,599 --> 01:06:04,039
be very helpful

1139
01:06:04,039 --> 01:06:05,880
um

1140
01:06:05,880 --> 01:06:12,119
for for many of you guys uh Trading

1141
01:06:25,880 --> 01:06:27,799
so yeah that that was a lot that was a

1142
01:06:27,799 --> 01:06:29,440
mouthful

1143
01:06:29,440 --> 01:06:32,079
um I'm tired I actually took a little

1144
01:06:32,079 --> 01:06:35,440
entry during that the mouthful as well

1145
01:06:35,440 --> 01:06:38,440
um but let me

1146
01:06:38,920 --> 01:06:43,559
just take it out here I think I'm going

1147
01:06:46,680 --> 01:06:49,680
close

1148
01:06:52,200 --> 01:06:57,520
here this looks like it may push a up um

1149
01:06:59,920 --> 01:07:01,319
[Music]

1150
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:05,400
2011 uh is what I'm closing at but I'm

1151
01:07:05,400 --> 01:07:07,920
looking for price to get up to 2115

1152
01:07:07,920 --> 01:07:11,720
that's what I was looking

1153
01:07:14,799 --> 01:07:17,319
for oh my gosh

1154
01:07:17,319 --> 01:07:21,680
don't oh okay

1155
01:07:31,520 --> 01:07:33,799
look at that I tell them where my my

1156
01:07:33,799 --> 01:07:35,799
target is they just turn the other way

1157
01:07:35,799 --> 01:07:38,160
don't worry I'm in at the low

1158
01:07:38,160 --> 01:07:41,839
so they'd have to come and be me down

1159
01:07:41,839 --> 01:07:45,319
here and that's what they just did be me

1160
01:07:45,319 --> 01:07:48,160
thank you thank you

1161
01:07:48,160 --> 01:07:50,920
price and that funny soon soon as you

1162
01:07:50,920 --> 01:07:52,559
say you

1163
01:07:52,559 --> 01:07:56,200
in soon as you say you in but I I still

1164
01:07:56,200 --> 01:07:58,000
think we getting getting back up above

1165
01:07:58,000 --> 01:08:00,760
that 2011 again um but I want to see

1166
01:08:00,760 --> 01:08:04,480
price uh hit that

1167
01:08:07,319 --> 01:08:10,200
214

1168
01:08:10,200 --> 01:08:12,680
yeah look at y'all see how they just ran

1169
01:08:12,680 --> 01:08:15,920
right back down to get me me out of all

1170
01:08:15,920 --> 01:08:18,359
people

1171
01:08:18,719 --> 01:08:22,319
me what did I

1172
01:08:23,439 --> 01:08:28,519
do I'm maging going for that on 2011

1173
01:08:38,000 --> 01:08:42,759
there so yeah that uh

1174
01:08:44,279 --> 01:08:47,719
um uh

1175
01:08:47,719 --> 01:08:50,960
uh the little breakdown that I gave you

1176
01:08:50,960 --> 01:08:54,198
guys of this um that's something that

1177
01:08:54,198 --> 01:08:57,399
you you guys should um

1178
01:08:57,399 --> 01:09:00,080
100% uh

1179
01:09:00,080 --> 01:09:04,279
uh you know write down and and sort of

1180
01:09:04,279 --> 01:09:06,839
try to understand from the higher time

1181
01:09:06,839 --> 01:09:08,238
frame to the lower time frame anything

1182
01:09:08,238 --> 01:09:10,960
that I was explaining just now just has

1183
01:09:10,960 --> 01:09:13,839
a lot more to do with the fractal nature

1184
01:09:13,839 --> 01:09:18,399
of price and and not anything that's

1185
01:09:18,399 --> 01:09:21,799
tied to like any kind of you know Enigma

1186
01:09:21,799 --> 01:09:28,198
strategy now um I am coming out with a

1187
01:09:28,198 --> 01:09:33,439
10 a.m. model um for for uh some of the

1188
01:09:33,439 --> 01:09:35,640
students to use so it's something that

1189
01:09:35,640 --> 01:09:37,880
they can definitively and mechanically

1190
01:09:37,880 --> 01:09:44,439
use after 10:00 a.m. to um begin to find

1191
01:09:44,439 --> 01:09:49,759
that that uh uh you know sort of easy

1192
01:09:49,759 --> 01:09:53,679
entry instead of trying to be a part of

1193
01:09:53,679 --> 01:09:56,520
the market open move and get absolutely

1194
01:09:56,520 --> 01:09:59,640
blitzed like I am at break even here

1195
01:09:59,640 --> 01:10:01,840
just crazy they they just they don't

1196
01:10:01,840 --> 01:10:03,440
want me to be

1197
01:10:03,440 --> 01:10:06,679
great Sam please I don't want to go back

1198
01:10:06,679 --> 01:10:10,400
to to to midnight I don't I don't want

1199
01:10:10,400 --> 01:10:12,760
to go back to spread Sam please hold the

1200
01:10:12,760 --> 01:10:15,320
maret up

1201
01:10:16,960 --> 01:10:21,000
Sam hold the maret up

1202
01:10:23,960 --> 01:10:27,880
please so yeah yeah

1203
01:10:28,880 --> 01:10:34,760
um all right there we go again thank

1204
01:10:43,080 --> 01:10:47,080
you I'd wait until

1205
01:10:48,960 --> 01:10:52,960
47 really

1206
01:11:07,920 --> 01:11:10,920
yeah and then that internal High that's

1207
01:11:10,920 --> 01:11:12,880
there that did not make it as a part of

1208
01:11:12,880 --> 01:11:16,120
structure right here is what I'm

1209
01:11:16,120 --> 01:11:19,800
thinking could be

1210
01:11:21,040 --> 01:11:25,040
um Scout

1211
01:11:43,719 --> 01:11:47,239
let me see

1212
01:12:10,639 --> 01:12:14,360
let me see

1213
01:12:36,719 --> 01:12:39,400
all right

1214
01:12:39,560 --> 01:12:42,280
so we have this here I'm thinking price

1215
01:12:42,280 --> 01:12:47,000
is looking to uh come back to this right

1216
01:12:47,000 --> 01:12:49,760
here get back into

1217
01:12:49,760 --> 01:12:54,400
this Zone up above here so this would be

1218
01:12:54,400 --> 01:12:56,840
the um

1219
01:12:56,840 --> 01:12:58,960
down candle you're going to see price

1220
01:12:58,960 --> 01:13:03,639
close up above to move back in to trade

1221
01:13:03,639 --> 01:13:06,760
higher we don't have that yet so we have

1222
01:13:06,760 --> 01:13:09,960
nothing uh we do have that

1223
01:13:09,960 --> 01:13:14,560
little what time frame is this

1224
01:13:23,040 --> 01:13:27,480
okay oh they they here

1225
01:13:28,719 --> 01:13:32,560
comes here comes that that uh let's see

1226
01:13:32,560 --> 01:13:34,719
I'm going second 12 seconds left I told

1227
01:13:34,719 --> 01:13:41,280
y'all about my U favorite candle right

1228
01:13:49,810 --> 01:13:53,270
[Music]

1229
01:14:07,560 --> 01:14:10,600
oh so this is this is still the target

1230
01:14:10,600 --> 01:14:14,320
this is still um what we need to close

1231
01:14:14,320 --> 01:14:16,600
up

1232
01:14:16,639 --> 01:14:22,560
above but now we're clearly here

1233
01:14:26,840 --> 01:14:29,480
all right

1234
01:14:29,480 --> 01:14:32,480
let's

1235
01:14:34,520 --> 01:14:38,280
sweep right here is the

1236
01:14:38,280 --> 01:14:42,280
high this is where you need the

1237
01:14:46,840 --> 01:14:50,320
close and I'm trying to figure out if

1238
01:14:50,320 --> 01:14:53,440
it's the 30 second has the candle that I

1239
01:14:53,440 --> 01:14:57,000
want the one minute doesn't

1240
01:14:57,800 --> 01:15:02,920
actually no the oh yeah it does it

1241
01:15:09,800 --> 01:15:12,840
does yeah so I'm thinking back to that

1242
01:15:12,840 --> 01:15:16,440
uh uh 178

1243
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:20,320
181 uh area over

1244
01:15:20,320 --> 01:15:23,600
there I think that's what we could

1245
01:15:23,600 --> 01:15:28,080
um be looking going to spring back up to

1246
01:15:28,080 --> 01:15:30,930
um I'm going to take a

1247
01:15:30,930 --> 01:15:32,480
[Music]

1248
01:15:32,480 --> 01:15:35,480
to

1249
01:15:40,760 --> 01:15:44,040
170 yeah

1250
01:15:47,280 --> 01:15:49,760
170 bet you guys might want to wait for

1251
01:15:49,760 --> 01:15:55,480
the close above um 48

1252
01:16:23,360 --> 01:16:26,920
yeah 148

1253
01:16:45,639 --> 01:16:47,040
we delivered a one to one from the

1254
01:16:47,040 --> 01:16:48,400
hourly

1255
01:16:48,400 --> 01:16:51,800
Zone Ah that's beautiful um I think

1256
01:16:51,800 --> 01:16:53,840
there that hourly higher time frame Zone

1257
01:16:53,840 --> 01:16:56,840
you talked about to the left

1258
01:16:57,199 --> 01:17:00,480
right yeah that's

1259
01:17:00,480 --> 01:17:03,480
nice

1260
01:17:04,600 --> 01:17:07,520
um I still don't have a closure yet but

1261
01:17:07,520 --> 01:17:10,120
I might be looking to take a long off of

1262
01:17:10,120 --> 01:17:13,120
117

1263
01:17:27,080 --> 01:17:28,639
this hasn't gone up above the down

1264
01:17:28,639 --> 01:17:32,760
candle yet so you stuck with

1265
01:17:38,880 --> 01:17:43,120
nothing yeah I don't

1266
01:18:14,080 --> 01:18:16,040
and there's my favorite candle telling

1267
01:18:16,040 --> 01:18:18,000
me

1268
01:18:18,000 --> 01:18:23,199
that you're getting ready to have

1269
01:18:28,840 --> 01:18:32,760
a little move back into this

1270
01:18:34,400 --> 01:18:36,880
range so when this candle stops I'm

1271
01:18:36,880 --> 01:18:39,520
going take a long right to this high

1272
01:18:39,520 --> 01:18:43,280
right here what's that

1273
01:18:43,280 --> 01:18:46,280
29

1274
01:18:46,440 --> 01:18:50,440
yeah 29

1275
01:19:11,360 --> 01:19:14,440
and being that these are um quite a bit

1276
01:19:14,440 --> 01:19:18,639
of swings on the way down um what is

1277
01:19:18,639 --> 01:19:23,480
this uh let me see so it's one two three

1278
01:19:23,480 --> 01:19:27,480
four five that's the fifth swing

1279
01:19:29,320 --> 01:19:32,440
there the fifth swing there and you have

1280
01:19:32,440 --> 01:19:36,320
this one to one up here at

1281
01:19:37,080 --> 01:19:40,320
178 uh

1282
01:19:42,000 --> 01:19:44,520
that's what I'm thinking with this

1283
01:19:44,520 --> 01:19:47,440
careful of

1284
01:19:50,480 --> 01:19:54,320
that like I see the the momentum heading

1285
01:19:54,320 --> 01:19:55,719
down

1286
01:19:55,719 --> 01:19:58,120
but you usually

1287
01:19:58,120 --> 01:20:01,800
expect you know some sort of retracement

1288
01:20:01,800 --> 01:20:03,679
that's about half to

1289
01:20:03,679 --> 01:20:08,199
move back into that direction and then

1290
01:20:08,199 --> 01:20:10,440
if it wants to head down again then you

1291
01:20:10,440 --> 01:20:12,800
have the same type of dip down and then

1292
01:20:12,800 --> 01:20:16,920
you assume some sort of retracement back

1293
01:20:16,920 --> 01:20:19,679
into when it's moving down in structure

1294
01:20:19,679 --> 01:20:22,960
like that so right now the only reason

1295
01:20:22,960 --> 01:20:27,000
why I'm even taking along down here is

1296
01:20:27,000 --> 01:20:29,639
it has more or less to do with me being

1297
01:20:29,639 --> 01:20:32,679
in the lower portion of the zone you

1298
01:20:32,679 --> 01:20:35,400
know being at the bottom of the range um

1299
01:20:35,400 --> 01:20:37,920
and after the sweep that was in

1300
01:20:37,920 --> 01:20:41,719
there so you saw it run out both of

1301
01:20:41,719 --> 01:20:44,440
these uh lows inside of there you saw it

1302
01:20:44,440 --> 01:20:47,719
tap right into this zone lower and then

1303
01:20:47,719 --> 01:20:50,199
a push back into that range and I

1304
01:20:50,199 --> 01:20:52,960
usually tell people um Target the 50% of

1305
01:20:52,960 --> 01:20:54,639
the imbalance or you can Target the

1306
01:20:54,639 --> 01:21:00,480
previous candles high on a uh scalp like

1307
01:21:02,040 --> 01:21:06,440
that so if you know

1308
01:21:06,679 --> 01:21:11,639
um the momentum that you're heading down

1309
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:14,480
in right and then the momentum that

1310
01:21:14,480 --> 01:21:17,400
you're heading back up

1311
01:21:17,400 --> 01:21:20,320
in and then the momentum that you're

1312
01:21:20,320 --> 01:21:23,400
heading back down in and then the

1313
01:21:23,400 --> 01:21:25,360
momentum that you're heading

1314
01:21:25,360 --> 01:21:29,560
back up in if you look at it it ends up

1315
01:21:29,560 --> 01:21:32,260
looking like this very

1316
01:21:32,260 --> 01:21:35,409
[Music]

1317
01:21:36,000 --> 01:21:38,440
structured moves even if there's

1318
01:21:38,440 --> 01:21:41,199
consolidation below here that's the

1319
01:21:41,199 --> 01:21:42,360
thing that a lot of people don't see or

1320
01:21:42,360 --> 01:21:43,920
a little consolidation that happened

1321
01:21:43,920 --> 01:21:46,080
within here before the drop or a little

1322
01:21:46,080 --> 01:21:48,080
consolidation here that happened you

1323
01:21:48,080 --> 01:21:49,760
know right there or a little

1324
01:21:49,760 --> 01:21:52,360
consolidation is here that happened here

1325
01:21:52,360 --> 01:21:54,199
a lot of people see these consolidating

1326
01:21:54,199 --> 01:21:55,080
points

1327
01:21:55,080 --> 01:21:58,199
and you see a push up above it it goes

1328
01:21:58,199 --> 01:22:00,440
down below it a push down below it it

1329
01:22:00,440 --> 01:22:02,719
moves back up above it a push back up

1330
01:22:02,719 --> 01:22:04,760
above it it goes back down below it a

1331
01:22:04,760 --> 01:22:06,639
push down below that consolidation it

1332
01:22:06,639 --> 01:22:08,560
goes back up above it so a lot of people

1333
01:22:08,560 --> 01:22:11,520
get caught up in

1334
01:22:11,520 --> 01:22:16,360
that right not understanding that if you

1335
01:22:16,360 --> 01:22:17,960
zoom

1336
01:22:17,960 --> 01:22:20,639
out this is

1337
01:22:20,639 --> 01:22:26,400
all this all has its its uh purpose

1338
01:22:26,400 --> 01:22:28,440
everything within there that essentially

1339
01:22:28,440 --> 01:22:30,560
moves it higher then it's there and then

1340
01:22:30,560 --> 01:22:32,520
it moves it lower then it's there and

1341
01:22:32,520 --> 01:22:34,080
then it trades up above there and then

1342
01:22:34,080 --> 01:22:36,120
it's there then it moves back down below

1343
01:22:36,120 --> 01:22:37,719
there and then it's there and then it

1344
01:22:37,719 --> 01:22:39,800
drops lower and then it's there at the

1345
01:22:39,800 --> 01:22:41,360
bottom

1346
01:22:41,360 --> 01:22:44,080
right and then drops lower and then

1347
01:22:44,080 --> 01:22:45,600
there and then drops lower and then

1348
01:22:45,600 --> 01:22:47,760
moves back up like

1349
01:22:47,760 --> 01:22:51,159
that so guess what within there there

1350
01:22:51,159 --> 01:22:53,960
there there if you can count that you

1351
01:22:53,960 --> 01:22:56,000
can time

1352
01:22:56,000 --> 01:22:59,719
if you can count that you can trade

1353
01:23:17,760 --> 01:23:22,280
it so that's uh

1354
01:23:22,760 --> 01:23:26,440
uh my uh

1355
01:23:28,000 --> 01:23:32,639
uh you know reasons for sort of what I'm

1356
01:23:32,639 --> 01:23:34,480
looking

1357
01:23:34,480 --> 01:23:37,679
at and why I trade even in in the way

1358
01:23:37,679 --> 01:23:40,719
that I do this entire move down somebody

1359
01:23:40,719 --> 01:23:43,600
can take Longs I mean uh uh shorts

1360
01:23:43,600 --> 01:23:45,360
heading down and count their swings as

1361
01:23:45,360 --> 01:23:46,760
it's heading

1362
01:23:46,760 --> 01:23:50,159
down somebody can do that and I can take

1363
01:23:50,159 --> 01:23:52,159
a trade at the beginning of every single

1364
01:23:52,159 --> 01:23:55,320
swing that reveal feels itself every

1365
01:23:55,320 --> 01:23:57,679
single swing that pumps back into the

1366
01:23:57,679 --> 01:24:01,800
other direction I can take a a long

1367
01:24:01,800 --> 01:24:05,960
with if I know the origination of that

1368
01:24:05,960 --> 01:24:08,360
where it's going to happen

1369
01:24:08,360 --> 01:24:11,080
right and I know what it's turning

1370
01:24:11,080 --> 01:24:13,320
around to

1371
01:24:13,320 --> 01:24:16,440
Target I can be a part of that that

1372
01:24:16,440 --> 01:24:19,440
entry

1373
01:24:25,560 --> 01:24:29,360
expecting Candlestick flip for higher um

1374
01:24:29,360 --> 01:24:32,800
possibility a possibility

1375
01:24:34,560 --> 01:24:36,840
yeah and that's the thing if it if it

1376
01:24:36,840 --> 01:24:40,360
ends up creating imbalances and you know

1377
01:24:40,360 --> 01:24:42,960
you have it uh going lower let's say

1378
01:24:42,960 --> 01:24:44,560
it's like that if it ends up creating

1379
01:24:44,560 --> 01:24:47,159
imbalances on the way down that's

1380
01:24:47,159 --> 01:24:50,800
fine trailing these highs right trailing

1381
01:24:50,800 --> 01:24:53,360
these down candle Highs are what saved

1382
01:24:53,360 --> 01:24:58,119
me from getting into an entry

1383
01:24:58,119 --> 01:25:00,760
prematurely when the invalidation would

1384
01:25:00,760 --> 01:25:03,679
be behind this

1385
01:25:04,440 --> 01:25:07,679
low right

1386
01:25:09,280 --> 01:25:11,600
there the invalidation will be right

1387
01:25:11,600 --> 01:25:16,360
behind this low so getting into an entry

1388
01:25:16,360 --> 01:25:19,639
prematurely it would

1389
01:25:19,639 --> 01:25:22,639
just be trailing behind these lows these

1390
01:25:22,639 --> 01:25:24,639
down candle lows I mean sorry down

1391
01:25:24,639 --> 01:25:28,159
candle highs and you would just need

1392
01:25:28,159 --> 01:25:31,880
price to close up above it close up

1393
01:25:31,880 --> 01:25:34,760
above that previous

1394
01:25:37,159 --> 01:25:41,119
high so I got beat again on that

1395
01:25:41,119 --> 01:25:46,119
one I'm still seeing that 129 there it's

1396
01:25:46,119 --> 01:25:48,159
just not

1397
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:51,679
um coming to

1398
01:25:52,880 --> 01:25:55,560
fruition and I guess maybe my targets

1399
01:25:55,560 --> 01:25:57,679
could be just a little

1400
01:25:57,679 --> 01:26:00,440
too my initial targets might be just a

1401
01:26:00,440 --> 01:26:03,560
little too

1402
01:26:05,520 --> 01:26:09,040
um too distant for myself but I think

1403
01:26:09,040 --> 01:26:10,920
that that 29

1404
01:26:10,920 --> 01:26:13,360
is is

1405
01:26:13,360 --> 01:26:16,159
good it's just price is

1406
01:26:16,159 --> 01:26:19,840
not giving me

1407
01:26:22,800 --> 01:26:25,880
that so you usually what I look for here

1408
01:26:25,880 --> 01:26:29,360
is this is a sweep on the lower time

1409
01:26:29,360 --> 01:26:31,560
frame right so if I'm looking at that

1410
01:26:31,560 --> 01:26:34,880
sweep on the lower time frame and you

1411
01:26:34,880 --> 01:26:37,400
now have price trading up above to that

1412
01:26:37,400 --> 01:26:41,560
same candle's high that would be a sweep

1413
01:26:41,560 --> 01:26:45,199
of that low and a sweep of that high

1414
01:26:45,199 --> 01:26:47,880
that occurred so that would be a down

1415
01:26:47,880 --> 01:26:51,600
move right that put in an up move it

1416
01:26:51,600 --> 01:26:53,639
traded lower below it and then it traded

1417
01:26:53,639 --> 01:26:56,400
back up above of it that's what that

1418
01:26:56,400 --> 01:26:59,719
down candle closure

1419
01:27:01,400 --> 01:27:04,119
is and that's why it's better to wait

1420
01:27:04,119 --> 01:27:07,320
for the down candle closure than to

1421
01:27:07,320 --> 01:27:12,199
scalp the way that um you know I do with

1422
01:27:12,199 --> 01:27:15,440
the initial tap into the Zone most

1423
01:27:15,440 --> 01:27:17,679
people may not know what zone they're

1424
01:27:17,679 --> 01:27:19,159
they're

1425
01:27:19,159 --> 01:27:22,119
um you know essentially trading from or

1426
01:27:22,119 --> 01:27:25,040
trusting right now I'm looking for an

1427
01:27:25,040 --> 01:27:28,000
entry long within here because we're in

1428
01:27:28,000 --> 01:27:31,560
the lower portion of our zone right and

1429
01:27:31,560 --> 01:27:35,560
I'm looking for price to get back into

1430
01:27:35,560 --> 01:27:38,880
at least that 30% portion and

1431
01:27:38,880 --> 01:27:42,119
potentially the high the um the high of

1432
01:27:42,119 --> 01:27:44,719
the zone and this is because we've

1433
01:27:44,719 --> 01:27:48,280
deeply mitigated the zone now so my risk

1434
01:27:48,280 --> 01:27:52,040
can be a lot lower down below here than

1435
01:27:52,040 --> 01:27:56,360
me looking for higher prices up above

1436
01:27:56,360 --> 01:28:01,360
here my my uh uh uh stop loss isn't as

1437
01:28:01,360 --> 01:28:05,600
large in highs as it is in

1438
01:28:09,480 --> 01:28:12,920
lows so

1439
01:28:15,040 --> 01:28:19,040
um that's the only reason why I'm um

1440
01:28:19,040 --> 01:28:21,320
down here even paying attention to any

1441
01:28:21,320 --> 01:28:24,520
of this

1442
01:28:31,320 --> 01:28:33,440
all

1443
01:28:39,840 --> 01:28:43,199
right yeah

1444
01:28:44,840 --> 01:28:45,890
so

1445
01:28:45,890 --> 01:28:49,069
[Music]

1446
01:28:51,360 --> 01:28:55,679
um this is

1447
01:29:05,880 --> 01:29:08,880
let's

1448
01:29:11,400 --> 01:29:15,800
see so let me do this

1449
01:29:17,639 --> 01:29:19,840
instead he said one to one long

1450
01:29:19,840 --> 01:29:23,159
delivered yeah it it did so this this

1451
01:29:23,159 --> 01:29:27,119
entry let me let me show you guys how I

1452
01:29:27,119 --> 01:29:30,639
keep getting

1453
01:29:36,800 --> 01:29:40,239
Beed right there would be fine yeah let

1454
01:29:40,239 --> 01:29:43,639
me show you guys how I keep getting

1455
01:29:44,800 --> 01:29:47,520
Beed so now obviously I told you guys

1456
01:29:47,520 --> 01:29:51,960
I'm looking for us to trade into into

1457
01:29:51,960 --> 01:29:54,040
that region up above here so you see the

1458
01:29:54,040 --> 01:29:56,719
side is a little higher now but this is

1459
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:02,159
still within the same context here right

1460
01:30:02,159 --> 01:30:04,679
this is tapping back into this Wick

1461
01:30:04,679 --> 01:30:07,239
right and then we trade higher off of

1462
01:30:07,239 --> 01:30:09,760
the wick right same thing is here

1463
01:30:09,760 --> 01:30:12,119
tapping back into this Wick right and

1464
01:30:12,119 --> 01:30:13,719
then we trade higher off of the wick

1465
01:30:13,719 --> 01:30:16,159
that was my initial Target stopped out

1466
01:30:16,159 --> 01:30:19,239
again at the lows cool trading back into

1467
01:30:19,239 --> 01:30:21,679
this Wick right there's that Target

1468
01:30:21,679 --> 01:30:24,760
again 129 you see how much is delivering

1469
01:30:24,760 --> 01:30:26,800
though is giving me my 10

1470
01:30:26,800 --> 01:30:30,040
points my 10 points that that is giving

1471
01:30:30,040 --> 01:30:32,320
me my 10

1472
01:30:32,320 --> 01:30:35,400
points but that's when the target is too

1473
01:30:35,400 --> 01:30:39,159
far away I'm cutting myself short of the

1474
01:30:39,159 --> 01:30:41,719
profit that's in here the profit that's

1475
01:30:41,719 --> 01:30:44,800
also here and if there's another low The

1476
01:30:44,800 --> 01:30:46,520
Profit that goes back into there I'm

1477
01:30:46,520 --> 01:30:48,760
cutting myself short by trying to Target

1478
01:30:48,760 --> 01:30:50,480
something that price may very well not

1479
01:30:50,480 --> 01:30:55,920
be ready to to you know take out

1480
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:01,119
so why not just take the previous

1481
01:31:01,119 --> 01:31:03,360
candles High previous candles low you

1482
01:31:03,360 --> 01:31:05,800
know why why not just uh shoot for

1483
01:31:05,800 --> 01:31:09,679
targets like that Nimble

1484
01:31:09,679 --> 01:31:12,199
targets instead and you can quickly pay

1485
01:31:12,199 --> 01:31:15,280
yourself get out and and enjoy the rest

1486
01:31:15,280 --> 01:31:17,199
of your

1487
01:31:17,199 --> 01:31:20,360
day and it doesn't have to be on 10

1488
01:31:20,360 --> 01:31:23,960
contracts that whole run up that it made

1489
01:31:23,960 --> 01:31:26,679
that was 200 bucks 10 points

1490
01:31:26,679 --> 01:31:30,920
already 400 bucks on two

1491
01:31:33,880 --> 01:31:36,280
contracts you know but th those are

1492
01:31:36,280 --> 01:31:38,719
things that that we you know kind of

1493
01:31:38,719 --> 01:31:40,800
deal with as Traders where we measured

1494
01:31:40,800 --> 01:31:42,600
this out and we said we wanted to go and

1495
01:31:42,600 --> 01:31:45,080
take that right there and we're up a

1496
01:31:45,080 --> 01:31:47,040
considerable amount and then what bam it

1497
01:31:47,040 --> 01:31:48,840
stops us out and then goes goes the way

1498
01:31:48,840 --> 01:31:51,000
that

1499
01:31:51,000 --> 01:31:53,960
the we want it or or it could it could

1500
01:31:53,960 --> 01:31:56,600
go the other way it could go down again

1501
01:31:56,600 --> 01:31:58,679
but bam it stops us out and then goes

1502
01:31:58,679 --> 01:32:00,960
goes the way we

1503
01:32:00,960 --> 01:32:07,920
want you know um so I I think that um uh

1504
01:32:07,920 --> 01:32:09,920
when we're in price actions that are

1505
01:32:09,920 --> 01:32:12,280
like this you know in general we get a

1506
01:32:12,280 --> 01:32:14,360
lot of that consolidation there remember

1507
01:32:14,360 --> 01:32:18,239
what I said I said

1508
01:32:18,360 --> 01:32:21,239
that if this is the tap that's in the

1509
01:32:21,239 --> 01:32:24,560
zone right and this is the previous High

1510
01:32:24,560 --> 01:32:27,920
that's here right that tap that's in the

1511
01:32:27,920 --> 01:32:30,080
zone that you're taking the manipulated

1512
01:32:30,080 --> 01:32:34,119
tap what you're targeting is whatever

1513
01:32:34,119 --> 01:32:35,920
the bullish

1514
01:32:35,920 --> 01:32:38,800
confirmation is right if you got in at

1515
01:32:38,800 --> 01:32:41,080
the lower portion of that tap so what is

1516
01:32:41,080 --> 01:32:43,719
the bullish confirmation the bullish

1517
01:32:43,719 --> 01:32:46,719
confirmation

1518
01:32:47,320 --> 01:32:50,040
is price trading up above the previous

1519
01:32:50,040 --> 01:32:51,840
candle's high and

1520
01:32:51,840 --> 01:32:54,480
closing it's the first thing there's not

1521
01:32:54,480 --> 01:32:56,159
there's not confirmation that that is

1522
01:32:56,159 --> 01:32:58,080
bullish confirmation to go and take out

1523
01:32:58,080 --> 01:33:00,560
this high now up above here but that's

1524
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:01,880
the first thing to say it's bullish

1525
01:33:01,880 --> 01:33:04,920
confirmation to get involved in a

1526
01:33:04,920 --> 01:33:07,440
pullback right get involved in we had

1527
01:33:07,440 --> 01:33:09,520
this huge drop that happened from here

1528
01:33:09,520 --> 01:33:11,920
right all the way down below here to

1529
01:33:11,920 --> 01:33:15,440
about 195 195 points so that move going

1530
01:33:15,440 --> 01:33:17,960
back up often times can retrace about

1531
01:33:17,960 --> 01:33:22,280
what 30 to 50% of that entire drop like

1532
01:33:22,280 --> 01:33:24,800
that right y y'all know that's where

1533
01:33:24,800 --> 01:33:29,199
people get the the um you know the the

1534
01:33:29,199 --> 01:33:32,679
OT uh stuff that they you see I put on

1535
01:33:32,679 --> 01:33:36,159
the FIB wrong the OT

1536
01:33:36,159 --> 01:33:39,239
ye you know uh

1537
01:33:39,239 --> 01:33:44,560
um entries to to uh short down that's

1538
01:33:44,560 --> 01:33:46,440
where they get that stuff up above there

1539
01:33:46,440 --> 01:33:49,199
so you know that if if it's designed to

1540
01:33:49,199 --> 01:33:51,760
even respect any of those Concepts like

1541
01:33:51,760 --> 01:33:54,320
that then it's

1542
01:33:54,320 --> 01:33:57,480
it it's designed to move that

1543
01:33:57,480 --> 01:34:00,320
way right likewise this is this is the

1544
01:34:00,320 --> 01:34:02,600
same thing the same thing down somebody

1545
01:34:02,600 --> 01:34:05,560
has you know this here and there's

1546
01:34:05,560 --> 01:34:08,280
there's their OT right

1547
01:34:08,280 --> 01:34:12,159
here they in their OT entry

1548
01:34:12,159 --> 01:34:14,239
here and there are times where they're

1549
01:34:14,239 --> 01:34:17,280
right and there are times where they're

1550
01:34:17,280 --> 01:34:21,080
not but being able to find moves within

1551
01:34:21,080 --> 01:34:24,360
just whatever part of the the algorithm

1552
01:34:24,360 --> 01:34:29,320
you're in and localize it to that part

1553
01:34:29,320 --> 01:34:33,000
right localize it to that part to take a

1554
01:34:33,000 --> 01:34:34,920
quick snap a quick scalp something like

1555
01:34:34,920 --> 01:34:37,600
that within there then you

1556
01:34:37,600 --> 01:34:40,800
know that's the essence of being able to

1557
01:34:40,800 --> 01:34:43,000
come in take a quality move and

1558
01:34:43,000 --> 01:34:45,560
go being able to come in take a quality

1559
01:34:45,560 --> 01:34:48,840
move and go so we

1560
01:34:48,840 --> 01:34:54,199
also pointed out that this is

1561
01:34:54,320 --> 01:34:56,679
so if I'm bullish back into this here I

1562
01:34:56,679 --> 01:34:58,800
would need to see us close up above this

1563
01:34:58,800 --> 01:35:01,199
high at 129 that's why I was targeting

1564
01:35:01,199 --> 01:35:04,239
that as the structural high but this

1565
01:35:04,239 --> 01:35:07,280
here is the previous candle's high that

1566
01:35:07,280 --> 01:35:09,440
we you saw us tap right into the Zone

1567
01:35:09,440 --> 01:35:12,360
here and then we go to run that's the

1568
01:35:12,360 --> 01:35:14,000
bullish confirmation the previous

1569
01:35:14,000 --> 01:35:16,639
candle's high so we trade up above that

1570
01:35:16,639 --> 01:35:19,080
previous candle's high right here and we

1571
01:35:19,080 --> 01:35:21,719
close right you see

1572
01:35:21,719 --> 01:35:24,600
there and we tap right into the 50% of

1573
01:35:24,600 --> 01:35:26,159
it right and then what do we do we

1574
01:35:26,159 --> 01:35:28,719
deliver a one to one right off of

1575
01:35:28,719 --> 01:35:32,280
it extends higher up above that but this

1576
01:35:32,280 --> 01:35:35,600
is still holding it

1577
01:35:35,600 --> 01:35:39,440
right with the potential Target

1578
01:35:39,440 --> 01:35:43,080
of the high here right and then that

1579
01:35:43,080 --> 01:35:47,400
that um imbalance that's up above

1580
01:35:47,400 --> 01:35:51,800
there so we have this up

1581
01:35:51,800 --> 01:35:54,400
move that it's getting re projected out

1582
01:35:54,400 --> 01:35:57,840
of uh here right but that's weakening

1583
01:35:57,840 --> 01:35:59,800
this move to where price could

1584
01:35:59,800 --> 01:36:03,760
potentially take out the high of of

1585
01:36:03,760 --> 01:36:07,639
uh the The Zone

1586
01:36:09,000 --> 01:36:12,360
itself and that's just the reading this

1587
01:36:12,360 --> 01:36:15,239
consolidating bit you know you have a

1588
01:36:15,239 --> 01:36:18,080
wick down here

1589
01:36:18,080 --> 01:36:20,480
right so you know that in this lower

1590
01:36:20,480 --> 01:36:22,400
portion should price stab below these

1591
01:36:22,400 --> 01:36:24,239
lows here you know it's little bounce

1592
01:36:24,239 --> 01:36:26,080
here that could move you back up into

1593
01:36:26,080 --> 01:36:27,639
here you know there there's a ton of

1594
01:36:27,639 --> 01:36:29,520
stuff within here that you can read to

1595
01:36:29,520 --> 01:36:32,280
be able to take little micros you know

1596
01:36:32,280 --> 01:36:34,440
snaps or scalps of a trade that could

1597
01:36:34,440 --> 01:36:36,760
result in 10 20 30

1598
01:36:36,760 --> 01:36:39,080
points if you were just in the right

1599
01:36:39,080 --> 01:36:42,119
position and waiting

1600
01:36:42,119 --> 01:36:44,800
right in the right position and waiting

1601
01:36:44,800 --> 01:36:47,159
and and you have some idea right of

1602
01:36:47,159 --> 01:36:48,560
where pric is

1603
01:36:48,560 --> 01:36:51,520
going don't forget

1604
01:36:51,520 --> 01:36:53,880
that cuz a lot of people think that they

1605
01:36:53,880 --> 01:36:57,560
can trade without knowing where exactly

1606
01:36:57,560 --> 01:37:00,560
it's it's going where it's reaching into

1607
01:37:00,560 --> 01:37:03,840
now for me I can start up here and say

1608
01:37:03,840 --> 01:37:05,719
hey I'm going to count my swings here I

1609
01:37:05,719 --> 01:37:07,840
already had the third swing here right

1610
01:37:07,840 --> 01:37:10,239
you guys heard me mention that it was it

1611
01:37:10,239 --> 01:37:13,920
was um the break of the the low on the

1612
01:37:13,920 --> 01:37:16,080
inside here then we had another one here

1613
01:37:16,080 --> 01:37:17,239
and we had another one here so we

1614
01:37:17,239 --> 01:37:19,600
already had three swings here so these

1615
01:37:19,600 --> 01:37:22,760
three swings I'm only considering

1616
01:37:22,760 --> 01:37:24,080
countering

1617
01:37:24,080 --> 01:37:26,800
moves after that that's my

1618
01:37:26,800 --> 01:37:30,760
personal my y'all hear me my personal

1619
01:37:30,760 --> 01:37:33,719
plan doesn't have to be yours it's mine

1620
01:37:33,719 --> 01:37:35,360
so when we started to drop here that's

1621
01:37:35,360 --> 01:37:37,040
where saying I'm looking for a long

1622
01:37:37,040 --> 01:37:38,360
somewhere around here guys I'm going to

1623
01:37:38,360 --> 01:37:40,280
take a long I'm looking for long

1624
01:37:40,280 --> 01:37:42,960
somewhere that's because my rules showed

1625
01:37:42,960 --> 01:37:46,960
up right my mechanical rules showed

1626
01:37:46,960 --> 01:37:51,080
up for me to start exploring the

1627
01:37:51,080 --> 01:37:55,199
possibility of scalping bels in a market

1628
01:37:55,199 --> 01:37:59,040
that's moving to the other side now I

1629
01:37:59,040 --> 01:38:01,480
anticipated consolidation and that's not

1630
01:38:01,480 --> 01:38:03,119
what we got we got a little brief

1631
01:38:03,119 --> 01:38:05,360
consolidation within there yes but It

1632
01:38:05,360 --> 01:38:07,960
ultimately led to a move back the other

1633
01:38:07,960 --> 01:38:10,280
way but back the other way is just

1634
01:38:10,280 --> 01:38:12,239
leading me to what the bottom of the

1635
01:38:12,239 --> 01:38:14,199
range so if it leads me back the other

1636
01:38:14,199 --> 01:38:16,080
way to the bottom of the range what does

1637
01:38:16,080 --> 01:38:18,760
it in turn do when I get to that bottom

1638
01:38:18,760 --> 01:38:20,760
of the range it leads me back to the

1639
01:38:20,760 --> 01:38:23,679
middle of the range or the top of the

1640
01:38:23,679 --> 01:38:26,880
range right so where do I consider

1641
01:38:26,880 --> 01:38:31,960
looking for Longs there not a a a trick

1642
01:38:31,960 --> 01:38:35,920
question Buy Low sell high

1643
01:38:35,920 --> 01:38:39,960
right Buy Low sell

1644
01:38:41,000 --> 01:38:45,199
High Buy Low sell high

1645
01:38:45,199 --> 01:38:47,520
right Buy

1646
01:38:47,520 --> 01:38:51,520
Low right

1647
01:38:55,440 --> 01:38:58,440
so

1648
01:38:58,880 --> 01:39:01,960
that's why I'm down here looking for

1649
01:39:01,960 --> 01:39:04,280
that side of the market yeah I might

1650
01:39:04,280 --> 01:39:06,320
have called out a couple you know oh you

1651
01:39:06,320 --> 01:39:08,880
could get to 129 and then you have 180

1652
01:39:08,880 --> 01:39:10,760
there and all these other things that

1653
01:39:10,760 --> 01:39:13,480
that's all speculative but when it comes

1654
01:39:13,480 --> 01:39:15,560
time to actually take the entry where

1655
01:39:15,560 --> 01:39:16,639
are you

1656
01:39:16,639 --> 01:39:19,480
entering it's I told you guys you could

1657
01:39:19,480 --> 01:39:21,400
listen to earlier in the video I had no

1658
01:39:21,400 --> 01:39:23,119
music in this video for a reason you

1659
01:39:23,119 --> 01:39:25,719
could fact check my words I said you can

1660
01:39:25,719 --> 01:39:27,960
wait until these sweeps that happen

1661
01:39:27,960 --> 01:39:30,760
below here and then you could look for a

1662
01:39:30,760 --> 01:39:33,000
move with price trading back up above

1663
01:39:33,000 --> 01:39:34,960
that's here in this video you go to the

1664
01:39:34,960 --> 01:39:36,679
time stamp and find it same way yall

1665
01:39:36,679 --> 01:39:38,280
like to find time stamps of people

1666
01:39:38,280 --> 01:39:40,040
saying wrong things you can find time

1667
01:39:40,040 --> 01:39:41,159
stamps with people saying the right

1668
01:39:41,159 --> 01:39:44,679
thing too right so

1669
01:39:44,679 --> 01:39:48,599
um that's that's you know what we get

1670
01:39:48,599 --> 01:39:51,159
and and I mentioned 129 right but it's

1671
01:39:51,159 --> 01:39:54,560
okay if I'm early

1672
01:39:54,560 --> 01:39:57,960
it's okay if I'm early looking for that

1673
01:39:57,960 --> 01:39:59,920
I know that there are times where I will

1674
01:39:59,920 --> 01:40:02,320
be early I told you guys that that

1675
01:40:02,320 --> 01:40:03,960
that's something that we all deal with

1676
01:40:03,960 --> 01:40:06,119
right that was even over here that was

1677
01:40:06,119 --> 01:40:08,199
earlier this morning I said I may

1678
01:40:08,199 --> 01:40:11,239
mention to this this example of us being

1679
01:40:11,239 --> 01:40:15,040
early we can legit be early before a

1680
01:40:15,040 --> 01:40:18,080
actual move back into the other end we

1681
01:40:18,080 --> 01:40:21,080
need to be prepared for that that was me

1682
01:40:21,080 --> 01:40:23,599
early right there

1683
01:40:23,599 --> 01:40:25,520
and then being able to find the re-entry

1684
01:40:25,520 --> 01:40:28,320
here to what still go to the same Target

1685
01:40:28,320 --> 01:40:32,159
same Target so yeah it traded lower and

1686
01:40:32,159 --> 01:40:34,159
and oh my gosh it didn't it didn't go to

1687
01:40:34,159 --> 01:40:35,560
the way I said it was going price

1688
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:37,239
doesn't have to immediately do what I'm

1689
01:40:37,239 --> 01:40:38,960
saying it's going to

1690
01:40:38,960 --> 01:40:41,880
do but as long as I'm aware of what it's

1691
01:40:41,880 --> 01:40:44,080
reaching into

1692
01:40:44,080 --> 01:40:45,639
now

1693
01:40:45,639 --> 01:40:49,320
then I'm able to trade in that direction

1694
01:40:49,320 --> 01:40:51,560
of the market why are you longing a

1695
01:40:51,560 --> 01:40:54,800
falling Market because ru

1696
01:40:54,800 --> 01:40:57,840
rules my rules already told me I could

1697
01:40:57,840 --> 01:40:59,840
not take any more shorts doesn't matter

1698
01:40:59,840 --> 01:41:01,599
if the market is shorted my rules say

1699
01:41:01,599 --> 01:41:03,000
you know

1700
01:41:03,000 --> 01:41:07,520
short Markus short you know

1701
01:41:08,599 --> 01:41:11,360
short and because that used to be a

1702
01:41:11,360 --> 01:41:14,040
handicap for

1703
01:41:14,040 --> 01:41:16,719
me right because that used to be a

1704
01:41:16,719 --> 01:41:19,560
handicap for me it used to be a handicap

1705
01:41:19,560 --> 01:41:21,280
for me that I used to try and short when

1706
01:41:21,280 --> 01:41:24,159
the market wasn't ready to Short

1707
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:26,599
youed be a handicap I'm in on this

1708
01:41:26,599 --> 01:41:28,239
little Wick here I'm in on this Wick

1709
01:41:28,239 --> 01:41:29,920
here I'm in on this Wick here every

1710
01:41:29,920 --> 01:41:31,480
single Wick I'm thinking price is

1711
01:41:31,480 --> 01:41:32,800
turning around

1712
01:41:32,800 --> 01:41:35,840
and because I used to have that

1713
01:41:35,840 --> 01:41:38,440
handicap I found a way to get ahead of

1714
01:41:38,440 --> 01:41:43,199
it by what just counting my

1715
01:41:44,920 --> 01:41:47,679
swings so now the handicap that I have

1716
01:41:47,679 --> 01:41:50,679
is actually the the strength it's my A+

1717
01:41:50,679 --> 01:41:53,760
setup I face that loss and when I kept

1718
01:41:53,760 --> 01:41:55,880
looking at it I said you keep doing this

1719
01:41:55,880 --> 01:41:59,679
dumb thing all the

1720
01:41:59,679 --> 01:42:02,679
time what is wrong with

1721
01:42:02,679 --> 01:42:06,760
you you keep doing this dumb

1722
01:42:08,280 --> 01:42:12,000
thing find a way to empower that flaw if

1723
01:42:12,000 --> 01:42:14,119
I'm impulsive it needs to be impulsive

1724
01:42:14,119 --> 01:42:16,800
in the right

1725
01:42:17,400 --> 01:42:20,520
spot if I'm

1726
01:42:20,520 --> 01:42:22,800
impulsive if I'm a person that Revenge

1727
01:42:22,800 --> 01:42:27,280
trade it needs to be in the right

1728
01:42:30,320 --> 01:42:33,719
spot and then I find a way to get in

1729
01:42:33,719 --> 01:42:35,960
look for what price is delivering to and

1730
01:42:35,960 --> 01:42:37,400
then I make my money from there and I

1731
01:42:37,400 --> 01:42:39,920
walk away and go on Twitter and just

1732
01:42:39,920 --> 01:42:42,199
laugh joke chat live your life do what

1733
01:42:42,199 --> 01:42:44,000
you going to do but you can come in and

1734
01:42:44,000 --> 01:42:46,760
do that that particular thing every

1735
01:42:46,760 --> 01:42:48,599
single

1736
01:42:48,599 --> 01:42:51,639
day every single day you can do that

1737
01:42:51,639 --> 01:42:54,440
particular thing

1738
01:42:54,440 --> 01:42:57,639
every day waiting on the other side of

1739
01:42:57,639 --> 01:42:59,840
what

1740
01:43:03,159 --> 01:43:06,960
10:30 waiting on the other side

1741
01:43:07,800 --> 01:43:11,199
10:30 and somebody said this is a this

1742
01:43:11,199 --> 01:43:15,800
is an hourly Wick up above here with a

1743
01:43:16,920 --> 01:43:22,159
10 to1 right here

1744
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,199
so somebody mentioned this is an hourly

1745
01:43:26,199 --> 01:43:29,599
Wick up above here so look at look at

1746
01:43:29,599 --> 01:43:31,280
what ends up this looks like is is

1747
01:43:31,280 --> 01:43:32,719
trading through that look at what ends

1748
01:43:32,719 --> 01:43:34,400
up

1749
01:43:34,400 --> 01:43:37,639
happening so what they end up doing with

1750
01:43:37,639 --> 01:43:42,040
this this is a zone right that

1751
01:43:42,040 --> 01:43:44,840
price tapped into right here that's the

1752
01:43:44,840 --> 01:43:47,440
flip the beginning right here what they

1753
01:43:47,440 --> 01:43:49,440
end up doing with this is they can go

1754
01:43:49,440 --> 01:43:53,320
here and bring it back up to there tra

1755
01:43:53,320 --> 01:43:55,440
away from the structural low and then

1756
01:43:55,440 --> 01:43:59,440
taking it run the low there and then go

1757
01:43:59,440 --> 01:44:05,440
all the way back up to that Wick that's

1758
01:44:05,440 --> 01:44:07,800
thereafter and that's why you're always

1759
01:44:07,800 --> 01:44:11,679
waiting for some type of sweep to

1760
01:44:11,679 --> 01:44:15,920
find the larger entry right some type of

1761
01:44:15,920 --> 01:44:19,320
sweep to find the larger entry you're

1762
01:44:19,320 --> 01:44:21,480
always waiting for that and anything

1763
01:44:21,480 --> 01:44:24,239
else that's within it is just a little

1764
01:44:24,239 --> 01:44:25,159
small

1765
01:44:25,159 --> 01:44:27,599
scalp if you're countering it's just a

1766
01:44:27,599 --> 01:44:29,679
little small scalp now this is the lower

1767
01:44:29,679 --> 01:44:31,360
portion of the range so remember what I

1768
01:44:31,360 --> 01:44:33,480
said we could potentially have a 30

1769
01:44:33,480 --> 01:44:36,639
point 30 to anywhere from 30 to 90 point

1770
01:44:36,639 --> 01:44:40,040
pullback from from you know within this

1771
01:44:40,040 --> 01:44:43,239
this um low here right or from whatever

1772
01:44:43,239 --> 01:44:46,719
low we were looking to tap into so this

1773
01:44:46,719 --> 01:44:50,760
move up ends up being a 47 point

1774
01:44:50,760 --> 01:44:53,280
pullback now we said it could it can you

1775
01:44:53,280 --> 01:44:55,280
know buy back up a third of the way or

1776
01:44:55,280 --> 01:44:57,760
even half of the way but nonetheless we

1777
01:44:57,760 --> 01:45:00,119
know that we're looking for a pullback

1778
01:45:00,119 --> 01:45:04,520
down below here that equals is greater

1779
01:45:04,520 --> 01:45:09,920
than or equal to about 30 to 90 points

1780
01:45:09,920 --> 01:45:12,080
to the other

1781
01:45:12,080 --> 01:45:17,800
side so now I have within that 30 to 90

1782
01:45:17,800 --> 01:45:22,199
point point uh uh you know uh uh

1783
01:45:22,199 --> 01:45:24,960
distance

1784
01:45:25,199 --> 01:45:28,920
I have to be able to figure out

1785
01:45:28,920 --> 01:45:33,280
something within there to pay

1786
01:45:33,280 --> 01:45:36,239
me this is not about being right about a

1787
01:45:36,239 --> 01:45:38,880
high or low being taken this is not

1788
01:45:38,880 --> 01:45:41,760
about being right more than the next

1789
01:45:41,760 --> 01:45:45,560
person there ain't about

1790
01:45:45,719 --> 01:45:48,320
that I need to find a way to get

1791
01:45:48,320 --> 01:45:50,159
involved in what I believe price is

1792
01:45:50,159 --> 01:45:54,360
currently doing now

1793
01:45:55,320 --> 01:45:58,760
and I find ways and it's always the same

1794
01:45:58,760 --> 01:46:01,760
consistent way each and every time the

1795
01:46:01,760 --> 01:46:09,719
same consistent way each and every

1796
01:46:21,920 --> 01:46:25,159
time you're not gonna do that to me you

1797
01:46:25,159 --> 01:46:28,760
better Target filled okay because that's

1798
01:46:28,760 --> 01:46:31,280
what I'm talking

1799
01:46:35,960 --> 01:46:39,679
about each and every time so I said that

1800
01:46:39,679 --> 01:46:44,080
my long comes after the sweep right and

1801
01:46:44,080 --> 01:46:47,599
I Look to trade to the

1802
01:46:47,599 --> 01:46:51,599
bullish confirmation

1803
01:46:53,199 --> 01:46:57,400
so there's my low to the bullish

1804
01:46:57,400 --> 01:46:59,159
confirmation

1805
01:46:59,159 --> 01:47:01,679
right very quick I was chatting and

1806
01:47:01,679 --> 01:47:03,440
compacting saying all these different

1807
01:47:03,440 --> 01:47:05,679
things and then I saw on the screen I

1808
01:47:05,679 --> 01:47:08,719
saw that Wick go weeps and then move

1809
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:10,960

01:47:47,159 --> 01:47:49,920
know still carrying over with with the

1821
01:47:49,920 --> 01:47:52,560
personality that I have in in the in the

1822
01:47:52,560 --> 01:47:54,360
group I forgot y'all in the public I got

1823
01:47:54,360 --> 01:47:56,840
to behave with

1824
01:47:56,840 --> 01:47:59,440
y'all I got to behave with y'all Y very

1825
01:47:59,440 --> 01:48:03,599
judgmental out here so you

1826
01:48:04,159 --> 01:48:07,599
know but yes okay I'm I'm done I'm done

1827
01:48:07,599 --> 01:48:11,920
uh um executing in there um I don't know

1828
01:48:11,920 --> 01:48:13,280
this still look like we pushing up to

1829
01:48:13,280 --> 01:48:16,480
that 29 but with that kind of momentum

1830
01:48:16,480 --> 01:48:19,119
down here looking like that uh again

1831
01:48:19,119 --> 01:48:21,840
that that retracement of that the larger

1832
01:48:21,840 --> 01:48:23,560
move is

1833
01:48:23,560 --> 01:48:25,119
uh what I was talking about so we can

1834
01:48:25,119 --> 01:48:28,239
get back here to this 42 but then

1835
01:48:28,239 --> 01:48:30,440
careful because that momentum up if it

1836
01:48:30,440 --> 01:48:33,040
keeps going it can go back to take out

1837
01:48:33,040 --> 01:48:35,560
this high at um not take out the high

1838
01:48:35,560 --> 01:48:39,800
but go back to test the

1839
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,480
177 yeah and can go back to test that

1840
01:48:44,480 --> 01:48:47,400
177

1841
01:48:47,400 --> 01:48:50,440
high up above here CU all that would be

1842
01:48:50,440 --> 01:48:54,480
is just trading back into what y'all

1843
01:48:54,480 --> 01:48:56,800
one to ones

1844
01:48:56,800 --> 01:48:59,159
right and all that would have been was

1845
01:48:59,159 --> 01:49:01,280
just you were just early in the Mojo of

1846
01:49:01,280 --> 01:49:01,920
the

1847
01:49:01,920 --> 01:49:06,639
50% and you see it dug

1848
01:49:07,440 --> 01:49:11,280
into that 70 yall know I said that's my

1849
01:49:11,280 --> 01:49:14,800
go-to save my life entry and then it

1850
01:49:14,800 --> 01:49:18,159
moves back to the 30 here with

1851
01:49:18,159 --> 01:49:20,400
potentially delivering the one to one

1852
01:49:20,400 --> 01:49:23,239
after which drops us back into

1853
01:49:23,239 --> 01:49:26,679
to it like

1854
01:49:26,679 --> 01:49:29,239
that so when it's something like that

1855
01:49:29,239 --> 01:49:31,760
all you're really looking for is

1856
01:49:31,760 --> 01:49:35,080
somewhere to take part in whatever kind

1857
01:49:35,080 --> 01:49:37,159
of

1858
01:49:37,159 --> 01:49:40,520
Entry you're seeking to take if I'm

1859
01:49:40,520 --> 01:49:42,920
looking to take Longs when we have that

1860
01:49:42,920 --> 01:49:45,639
extension up my business I already told

1861
01:49:45,639 --> 01:49:48,239
you guys is after the high is taken or

1862
01:49:48,239 --> 01:49:50,639
when price drops back into the range

1863
01:49:50,639 --> 01:49:54,239
that's it that's my entire TR plan and I

1864
01:49:54,239 --> 01:49:57,599
cannot trade utilizing anything else

1865
01:49:57,599 --> 01:49:59,280
other than

1866
01:49:59,280 --> 01:50:03,080
that so I need my sweep right higher

1867
01:50:03,080 --> 01:50:06,040
time frame sweep too and then now I'm

1868
01:50:06,040 --> 01:50:09,280
going to trade with whatever price has

1869
01:50:09,280 --> 01:50:11,480
established

1870
01:50:11,480 --> 01:50:13,480
already and when you trade with them

1871
01:50:13,480 --> 01:50:15,119
what price is established already it's a

1872
01:50:15,119 --> 01:50:17,440
lot easier than trying to guess what

1873
01:50:17,440 --> 01:50:19,760
price is going to

1874
01:50:19,760 --> 01:50:22,199
establish right trying to guess what

1875
01:50:22,199 --> 01:50:24,719
price is going to establish you don't

1876
01:50:24,719 --> 01:50:27,760
want to be the person doing

1877
01:50:27,760 --> 01:50:30,480
that so all up here I said that first in

1878
01:50:30,480 --> 01:50:31,840
Balance they could put in a new high

1879
01:50:31,840 --> 01:50:33,199
blah blah blah blah the 12 minute

1880
01:50:33,199 --> 01:50:35,000
imbalance all that is up there yeah all

1881
01:50:35,000 --> 01:50:36,960
of that is

1882
01:50:36,960 --> 01:50:39,840
there but when it comes time to actually

1883
01:50:39,840 --> 01:50:42,760
making the decision it's not being made

1884
01:50:42,760 --> 01:50:46,119
because that is there it's being made

1885
01:50:46,119 --> 01:50:50,560
because my rules have lined up so in

1886
01:50:50,560 --> 01:50:52,199
order for me to hold an entry long I

1887
01:50:52,199 --> 01:50:54,480
would have had had to have a flip right

1888
01:50:54,480 --> 01:50:56,639
cuzz I know the first tap is a

1889
01:50:56,639 --> 01:50:59,639
scalp that break structure that's why I

1890
01:50:59,639 --> 01:51:01,719
say that first flip is fake right the

1891
01:51:01,719 --> 01:51:04,639
second one usually double bottoms and

1892
01:51:04,639 --> 01:51:07,119
then trades out of there which entry are

1893
01:51:07,119 --> 01:51:09,040
you in are you in the first tap or are

1894
01:51:09,040 --> 01:51:13,119
you in the second tap and that begins to

1895
01:51:13,119 --> 01:51:14,840
you know alleviate some of those issues

1896
01:51:14,840 --> 01:51:16,040
that people have with just being a

1897
01:51:16,040 --> 01:51:17,639
little too early you're trying to manage

1898
01:51:17,639 --> 01:51:19,599
the stop loss of the first entry it's

1899
01:51:19,599 --> 01:51:22,000
the first entry if you try to manage the

1900
01:51:22,000 --> 01:51:23,760
stop loss of it you're likely to get

1901
01:51:23,760 --> 01:51:25,320
stopped out and price go way that you

1902
01:51:25,320 --> 01:51:27,520
were

1903
01:51:27,679 --> 01:51:30,040
anticipating so it's either set behind

1904
01:51:30,040 --> 01:51:31,920
the invalidated idea right that's where

1905
01:51:31,920 --> 01:51:35,639
your stop loss is or trade within the

1906
01:51:35,639 --> 01:51:37,480
understanding that first tap second tap

1907
01:51:37,480 --> 01:51:41,440
is is an actual thing

1908
01:51:42,239 --> 01:51:44,440
right

1909
01:51:44,440 --> 01:51:47,440
um Dave thinking he owns the X in future

1910
01:51:47,440 --> 01:51:50,800
space no I own me actually and I own the

1911
01:51:50,800 --> 01:51:55,239
level of discipline that I have and um I

1912
01:51:55,239 --> 01:52:00,159
uh make sure that I'm uh very uh uh

1913
01:52:00,159 --> 01:52:03,119

1915
01:52:05,480 --> 01:52:07,440
and I'm just confident in my ability to

1916
01:52:07,440 --> 01:52:10,280
follow my rules I'm not confident in in

1917
01:52:10,280 --> 01:52:13,000
being able to call whether price is

1918
01:52:13,000 --> 01:52:18,199
going to be you know in in 15,000 at at

1919
01:52:18,199 --> 01:52:23,920
you know quarter three of of 20 25 I'm

1920
01:52:23,920 --> 01:52:27,000
I'm not that's not me but I'm confident

1921
01:52:27,000 --> 01:52:30,000
in my ability to follow my own rules and

1922
01:52:30,000 --> 01:52:32,960
do the same thing each and every day and

01:52:32,960 --> 01:52:36,440

01:52:40,040 --> 01:52:43,159
for it and I cannot deviate from that

1926
01:52:43,159 --> 01:52:45,000
and if I come into the market with that

1927
01:52:45,000 --> 01:52:46,920
mindset each and every day and have that

1928
01:52:46,920 --> 01:52:48,560
discipline I'm going to have that
