to know

44
00:04:41,720 --> 00:04:47,240
why because you can't put an alarm clock

45
00:04:47,240 --> 00:04:48,280
in the

46
00:04:48,280 --> 00:04:50,479

47
00:04:50,479 --> 00:04:53,000
up so for some of y'all lazy ones that

48
00:04:53,000 --> 00:04:54,919
got to set the alarm to wake yourself up

49
00:04:54,919 --> 00:04:57,960
and your body hasn't set it for you as

50
00:04:57,960 --> 00:05:00,440
of yet

51
00:05:00,440 --> 00:05:04,280
it's a beautiful thing to wake up every

52
00:05:06,080 --> 00:05:09,479
day so uh let me see somebody said the

53
00:05:09,479 --> 00:05:13,320

TV so

68
00:06:03,120 --> 00:06:05,360
um actually I want to do a top down

69
00:06:05,360 --> 00:06:08,560
analysis with y'all real quick uh let me

70
00:06:08,560 --> 00:06:10,360
go

71
00:06:10,360 --> 00:06:15,199
to um the current contract

72
00:06:15,199 --> 00:06:18,960
right let me just do this

73
00:06:18,960 --> 00:06:21,000
first I should probably give youall

74
00:06:21,000 --> 00:06:24,280
levels to set until like next week right

75
00:06:24,280 --> 00:06:29,319
so we all like yeah do it do it

76
00:06:31,759 --> 00:06:34,759
uh

77
00:06:37,000 --> 00:06:41,160
so do you guys see that

78
00:06:41,160 --> 00:06:45,360
we cook that low right

79
00:06:49,199 --> 00:06:51,639
there when I did a top down analysis

80
00:06:51,639 --> 00:06:53,160
with the group yesterday I told them

81
00:06:53,160 --> 00:06:54,240
that I was

82
00:06:54,240 --> 00:06:56,680
anticipating um after this low was taken

83
00:06:56,680 --> 00:06:59,120
I was anticipating this low uh to be

84
00:06:59,120 --> 00:07:02,160
taken out as well this is that uh

85
00:07:02,160 --> 00:07:05,879
Wednesday January 31st low um and

86
00:07:05,879 --> 00:07:08,560
overnight y'all that yall y'all saw that

87
00:07:08,560 --> 00:07:11,960
momentum overnight that was that was

88
00:07:11,960 --> 00:07:16,280
something 360 points down

89
00:07:16,280 --> 00:07:19,319
overnight that was amazing that's why I

90
00:07:19,319 --> 00:07:21,759
said that with with these higher time

91
00:07:21,759 --> 00:07:22,560
frame

92
00:07:22,560 --> 00:07:25,160
moves this is it's not your business as

93
00:07:25,160 --> 00:07:26,160
a day

94
00:07:26,160 --> 00:07:28,520
trader this is not your

95
00:07:28,520 --> 00:07:30,560
business trying to figure out if this

96
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:32,960
log is taken so does that mean that now

97
00:07:32,960 --> 00:07:35,479
we go back up into no that's not your

98
00:07:35,479 --> 00:07:37,680
business when these higher time frame

99
00:07:37,680 --> 00:07:40,720
lows get taken they take them with Force

100
00:07:40,720 --> 00:07:43,479
yes they they split right through them

101
00:07:43,479 --> 00:07:47,639
like a banana take them with Force what

102
00:07:47,639 --> 00:07:51,240
is your business is after these

103
00:07:51,240 --> 00:07:53,560
people are ran

104
00:07:53,560 --> 00:07:58,039
out you have enough money at that point

105
00:07:58,039 --> 00:08:00,240
to be able to buy back up or trade back

106
00:08:00,240 --> 00:08:02,520
in

107
00:08:02,520 --> 00:08:07,759
so the other day we um did the top down

108
00:08:07,759 --> 00:08:09,000
we talked

109
00:08:09,000 --> 00:08:13,759
about the sng responsible for the break

110
00:08:13,759 --> 00:08:17,840
right so we get that out the

111
00:08:18,879 --> 00:08:22,720
way when we go down hit the top of it

112
00:08:22,720 --> 00:08:24,720
this you know we always anticipate

113
00:08:24,720 --> 00:08:27,759
something like that uh off of this move

114
00:08:27,759 --> 00:08:30,120
even if this is not set to whole there

115
00:08:30,120 --> 00:08:32,120
still is a possibility that price trades

116
00:08:32,120 --> 00:08:34,200
lower y'all y'all see every weekend how

117
00:08:34,200 --> 00:08:36,719
we get all of this news that just throws

118
00:08:36,719 --> 00:08:41,080
us down the other way again so um you

119
00:08:41,080 --> 00:08:42,599
know you don't want to be too much in

120
00:08:42,599 --> 00:08:45,839
haste um you know to have an opinion

121
00:08:45,839 --> 00:08:47,760
that oh now we hit here yeah we're going

122
00:08:47,760 --> 00:08:51,040
to get back up into the previous range

123
00:08:51,040 --> 00:08:53,880
there although it is a possibility I

124
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,880
mean you look we have this High we have

125
00:08:56,880 --> 00:08:59,000
this low right we close below so that

126
00:08:59,000 --> 00:09:01,399
validate dat at the high right we closed

127
00:09:01,399 --> 00:09:04,200
above so that caused the low to be a

128
00:09:04,200 --> 00:09:06,279
protected low This Is Us taking out that

129
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,519
protected low that's what this move is

130
00:09:09,519 --> 00:09:11,560
so when

131
00:09:11,560 --> 00:09:16,000
we bring up the previous range that we

132
00:09:16,000 --> 00:09:17,079
had right

133
00:09:17,079 --> 00:09:19,760
there we know

134
00:09:19,760 --> 00:09:25,279
that the thing we have is this

135
00:09:25,279 --> 00:09:27,560
fractal so the highest point we

136
00:09:27,560 --> 00:09:30,519
anticipate price to get to that's if it

137
00:09:30,519 --> 00:09:33,760
pushes to this fractal is at least right

138
00:09:33,760 --> 00:09:35,839
into the center of the fractal 50% of

139
00:09:35,839 --> 00:09:37,800
the fractal with the possibility of just

140
00:09:37,800 --> 00:09:40,120
flushing up above the fractal and then

141
00:09:40,120 --> 00:09:44,519
taking us back down like that back below

142
00:09:44,519 --> 00:09:49,959
it so when we go back below it that

143
00:09:49,959 --> 00:09:53,000
could give us enough momentum below here

144
00:09:53,000 --> 00:09:57,880
to move us back up above the high that

145
00:09:57,880 --> 00:10:00,880
was put in there to actually trade back

146
00:10:00,880 --> 00:10:04,480
into the previous range trade back into

147
00:10:04,480 --> 00:10:09,079
the 50% of the move so um last

148
00:10:09,079 --> 00:10:11,920
year um well I think it was early this

149
00:10:11,920 --> 00:10:15,680
year I had mentioned that this is

150
00:10:15,680 --> 00:10:17,720
probably just going to end up being in a

151
00:10:17,720 --> 00:10:22,640
Range so what we have here is the bottom

152
00:10:22,640 --> 00:10:25,519
of the range and what we have here is

153
00:10:25,519 --> 00:10:26,880
the top of the

154
00:10:26,880 --> 00:10:29,959
range and this is essentially

155
00:10:29,959 --> 00:10:32,320
the environment that we're going to be

156
00:10:32,320 --> 00:10:35,800
in we accumulate right after taking out

157
00:10:35,800 --> 00:10:38,200
what well we we don't have the data on

158
00:10:38,200 --> 00:10:39,480
this one but after taking out an all

159
00:10:39,480 --> 00:10:41,920
high to the left we accumulate so we

160
00:10:41,920 --> 00:10:45,200
took out that alltime high from 2021 so

161
00:10:45,200 --> 00:10:46,360
we

162
00:10:46,360 --> 00:10:49,200
accumulate and when we

163
00:10:49,200 --> 00:10:53,079
accumulate that creates enough orders

164
00:10:53,079 --> 00:10:57,240
enough momentum for us to either expand

165
00:10:57,240 --> 00:11:01,880
higher or trade lower so we need to

166
00:11:01,880 --> 00:11:02,880
understand that when we get into the

167
00:11:02,880 --> 00:11:07,880
environment that we're accumulating in

168
00:11:07,880 --> 00:11:09,760
we need to trade with an accumulating

169
00:11:09,760 --> 00:11:11,240
mindset I say that in all the videos

170
00:11:11,240 --> 00:11:13,079
that I post on this channel I say that

171
00:11:13,079 --> 00:11:15,720
you know in the mentorship as well um

172
00:11:15,720 --> 00:11:17,399
you know talk about it on Twitter

173
00:11:17,399 --> 00:11:19,560
everywhere you need to trade in an

174
00:11:19,560 --> 00:11:21,399
accumulating mindset somebody asked me

175
00:11:21,399 --> 00:11:22,959
what they what I thought Bitcoin was

176
00:11:22,959 --> 00:11:25,920
doing let's go to bitcoin I had

177
00:11:25,920 --> 00:11:27,279
mentioned that we traded up above this

178
00:11:27,279 --> 00:11:30,680
old high right on the day daily right

179
00:11:30,680 --> 00:11:33,000
the previous all-time high as well

180
00:11:33,000 --> 00:11:37,279
2021 what do we have going on

181
00:11:37,279 --> 00:11:42,079
here the same thing we were expecting on

182
00:11:42,079 --> 00:11:45,760
NQ we have accumulation taking place so

183
00:11:45,760 --> 00:11:47,920
this is the bottom of the range right

184
00:11:47,920 --> 00:11:49,800
and this is the top of the range right

185
00:11:49,800 --> 00:11:52,160
so you prioritize shorts in the top of

186
00:11:52,160 --> 00:11:54,279
the range you prioritize Longs in the

187
00:11:54,279 --> 00:11:56,920
bottom of the range and that's literally

188
00:11:56,920 --> 00:12:01,240
the whole essence of range Trading

189
00:12:01,480 --> 00:12:07,160
so for us to be in a larger range around

190
00:12:07,160 --> 00:12:10,600
here on on uh

191
00:12:10,600 --> 00:12:13,480
um uh uh whatever this pair's name is

192
00:12:13,480 --> 00:12:17,079
enq for us being a larger

193
00:12:17,079 --> 00:12:21,519
range on enq is the same exact

194
00:12:21,519 --> 00:12:24,760
thing we trade from the bottom of the

195
00:12:24,760 --> 00:12:26,320
range to the top of the range to the

196
00:12:26,320 --> 00:12:27,720
bottom of the range to the top of the

197
00:12:27,720 --> 00:12:31,800
range until price does what until it

198
00:12:31,800 --> 00:12:35,600
begins to trade lower and Target lows

199
00:12:35,600 --> 00:12:41,079
right heads back to the origin right or

200
00:12:41,079 --> 00:12:44,199
we end up going back for highs again now

201
00:12:44,199 --> 00:12:46,880
how would we you know essentially Point

202
00:12:46,880 --> 00:12:49,839
those things out um that's let me go

203
00:12:49,839 --> 00:12:53,760
back to the other contract

204
00:12:57,600 --> 00:13:00,399
that's that is BAS based

205
00:13:00,399 --> 00:13:04,360
on what we do within this range

206
00:13:04,360 --> 00:13:08,000
so if you look

207
00:13:08,000 --> 00:13:11,720
at the tops of the range let me just

208
00:13:11,720 --> 00:13:13,199
just take this

209
00:13:13,199 --> 00:13:16,519
there if you look at the tops of the

210
00:13:16,519 --> 00:13:18,760
range you see that anytime we trade it

211
00:13:18,760 --> 00:13:21,880
below and close below we trade it back

212
00:13:21,880 --> 00:13:24,320
to the bottom of the range right same

213
00:13:24,320 --> 00:13:26,800
thing here in the bottom of the range we

214
00:13:26,800 --> 00:13:29,279
trade up close above we head back back

215
00:13:29,279 --> 00:13:31,959
to the top of the range we close above

216
00:13:31,959 --> 00:13:35,720
right we continue to head up

217
00:13:35,720 --> 00:13:38,399
right this provided a close below but

218
00:13:38,399 --> 00:13:40,240
then we flush back up above the high

219
00:13:40,240 --> 00:13:42,519
that's that's fine th those things you

220
00:13:42,519 --> 00:13:45,160
know they occur um and that's why you

221
00:13:45,160 --> 00:13:47,959
got to make sure you take your profit so

222
00:13:47,959 --> 00:13:49,920
we end up getting a mini range within

223
00:13:49,920 --> 00:13:52,120
here but then when we trade back up

224
00:13:52,120 --> 00:13:55,399
again first of all the the closure above

225
00:13:55,399 --> 00:13:57,320
put us back into the top of the range

226
00:13:57,320 --> 00:13:59,560
the closure below put us back into the

227
00:13:59,560 --> 00:14:03,639
bottom of the range and at no point no

228
00:14:03,639 --> 00:14:07,079
point as as we began coming down did we

229
00:14:07,079 --> 00:14:12,480
get a closure back up above to price

230
00:14:12,480 --> 00:14:15,120
higher so we continue to get closures

231
00:14:15,120 --> 00:14:19,759
below right closures below right so in

232
00:14:19,759 --> 00:14:22,800
the event that and this is not just even

233
00:14:22,800 --> 00:14:24,600
you know counting today today could just

234
00:14:24,600 --> 00:14:26,560
you know end in a Range end as a dogee

235
00:14:26,560 --> 00:14:29,199
or something like that remember we

236
00:14:29,199 --> 00:14:31,040
anticipate that it's getting back to

237
00:14:31,040 --> 00:14:35,639
this fractal but in the event

238
00:14:35,639 --> 00:14:39,079
that we

239
00:14:39,480 --> 00:14:42,120
get a closure above let's say this

240
00:14:42,120 --> 00:14:43,480
candle closed like this it's not

241
00:14:43,480 --> 00:14:44,800
currently closed so you don't want to

242
00:14:44,800 --> 00:14:46,880
utilize this you know while it's still

243
00:14:46,880 --> 00:14:48,759
alive in the event that we get a body

244
00:14:48,759 --> 00:14:52,920
closure above like

245
00:14:54,880 --> 00:14:57,000
that then we know

246
00:14:57,000 --> 00:15:01,240
that that's a possibility ility to put

247
00:15:01,240 --> 00:15:05,320
us what we mention up

248
00:15:05,320 --> 00:15:07,120
above this

249
00:15:07,120 --> 00:15:11,959
high so us trading back up above this

250
00:15:12,360 --> 00:15:15,880
High we would nine times out of 10 get a

251
00:15:15,880 --> 00:15:19,839
rejection out of here back into that

252
00:15:19,839 --> 00:15:23,600
previous range below should we end up

253
00:15:23,600 --> 00:15:27,759
closing below a bullish candle so we end

254
00:15:27,759 --> 00:15:29,279
up closing with a body below bullish

255
00:15:29,279 --> 00:15:32,399
candle now that gives us that momentum

256
00:15:32,399 --> 00:15:34,720
to come back down and attack these

257
00:15:34,720 --> 00:15:37,040
lows so it's essentially following the

258
00:15:37,040 --> 00:15:39,720
same thing within the range whether it's

259
00:15:39,720 --> 00:15:41,519
the lows of the range whether it's the

260
00:15:41,519 --> 00:15:44,120
highs of the range it's the same exact

261
00:15:44,120 --> 00:15:49,000
thing so being that we're in a Range a

262
00:15:49,000 --> 00:15:51,959
range has structure on a lower time

263
00:15:51,959 --> 00:15:56,240
frame but the range

264
00:15:56,240 --> 00:16:01,000
itself the range itself is not bound by

265
00:16:01,000 --> 00:16:03,759
structure it's bound by

266
00:16:03,759 --> 00:16:05,839
extremes that's where we talk about the

267
00:16:05,839 --> 00:16:08,199
bottom of the range and the top of the

268
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,680
range so you'll see structure created

269
00:16:10,680 --> 00:16:13,040
and broken so many times within the

270
00:16:13,040 --> 00:16:14,560
range

271
00:16:14,560 --> 00:16:16,800
right many times within the range you

272
00:16:16,800 --> 00:16:18,600
see structure created and

273
00:16:18,600 --> 00:16:21,079
broken but on a lower time frame you'd

274
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:23,319
see structure leading to those different

275
00:16:23,319 --> 00:16:26,519
areas the the last thing you want to

276
00:16:26,519 --> 00:16:30,920
do is in the center of the Ring

277
00:16:30,920 --> 00:16:34,759
range you're holding a position

278
00:16:34,759 --> 00:16:38,720
here saying that price is going lower

279
00:16:38,720 --> 00:16:41,440
and we end up trading higher or saying

280
00:16:41,440 --> 00:16:43,920
that price is going higher and we end up

281
00:16:43,920 --> 00:16:45,800
trading

282
00:16:45,800 --> 00:16:48,680
lower this the thing you don't want to

283
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:51,079
do what would you what we understand

284
00:16:51,079 --> 00:16:53,880
with this is that the previous range

285
00:16:53,880 --> 00:16:56,680
that we have according to structure with

286
00:16:56,680 --> 00:16:59,600
that body closure that we just got

287
00:16:59,600 --> 00:17:01,920
is

288
00:17:02,160 --> 00:17:05,359
here right so we know

289
00:17:05,359 --> 00:17:10,880
that the run into this would just be

290
00:17:10,880 --> 00:17:14,039
providing a rejection back down now

291
00:17:14,039 --> 00:17:18,199
could we reject down trade back in again

292
00:17:18,199 --> 00:17:22,480
off of something in here fail there

293
00:17:22,480 --> 00:17:25,679
create an equal high within here to drop

294
00:17:25,679 --> 00:17:28,240
down and now take the lows absolutely

295
00:17:28,240 --> 00:17:31,200
but that would just end up creating

296
00:17:31,200 --> 00:17:34,039
what that would just end

297
00:17:34,039 --> 00:17:39,799
up sorry bringing us down here for what

298
00:17:39,799 --> 00:17:42,559
another move up

299
00:17:42,559 --> 00:17:46,160
again and we' just end up walking

300
00:17:46,160 --> 00:17:51,360
structure down on a higher time frame

301
00:17:51,360 --> 00:17:53,679
right and it doesn't mean that if we

302
00:17:53,679 --> 00:17:56,720
push up above that inside High there we

303
00:17:56,720 --> 00:18:00,520
can push up above there and not close

304
00:18:00,520 --> 00:18:03,120
we get no closure there we trade back

305
00:18:03,120 --> 00:18:05,840
below again look at what this leads into

306
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,039
this this kind of price

307
00:18:08,039 --> 00:18:10,240
action this kind of price action ends up

308
00:18:10,240 --> 00:18:13,919
leading into what later on in the

309
00:18:13,919 --> 00:18:17,280
year if that's the way price began to

310
00:18:17,280 --> 00:18:21,640
move because from this high right here

311
00:18:21,640 --> 00:18:23,559
when we first got here this is

312
00:18:23,559 --> 00:18:25,880
December so from

313
00:18:25,880 --> 00:18:29,000
December into where we currently are in

314
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:32,400
April we've been in the same

315
00:18:32,400 --> 00:18:36,640
spot yeah slightly higher

316
00:18:36,640 --> 00:18:40,480
than you know where where uh uh the end

317
00:18:40,480 --> 00:18:42,400
of December had us but it's still the

318
00:18:42,400 --> 00:18:44,679
same

319
00:18:45,039 --> 00:18:49,159
area so we need to understand that

320
00:18:49,159 --> 00:18:50,799
instead of trying to pick tops and

321
00:18:50,799 --> 00:18:53,120
bottoms based on the higher time frame

322
00:18:53,120 --> 00:18:57,360
we need to trade with that that

323
00:18:57,360 --> 00:18:59,360
ranged mind

324
00:18:59,360 --> 00:19:01,320
understanding that we're in

325
00:19:01,320 --> 00:19:03,520
accumulation anytime we trade below old

326
00:19:03,520 --> 00:19:05,880
low anytime we trade above old high we

327
00:19:05,880 --> 00:19:07,520
get

328
00:19:07,520 --> 00:19:09,039
accumulation

329
00:19:09,039 --> 00:19:11,600
so that's just it for the higher time

330
00:19:11,600 --> 00:19:12,640
frame

331
00:19:12,640 --> 00:19:15,640
context

332
00:19:16,080 --> 00:19:19,760
um for me

333
00:19:21,840 --> 00:19:24,360
here all I had marked out within here

334
00:19:24,360 --> 00:19:26,520
was this

335
00:19:26,520 --> 00:19:30,720
fractal you guys first saw me

336
00:19:31,039 --> 00:19:33,159
come on actually no I I had removed it

337
00:19:33,159 --> 00:19:35,280
before I came on this fractal that's

338
00:19:35,280 --> 00:19:37,720
below

339
00:19:37,880 --> 00:19:41,880
here so in the event that

340
00:19:42,159 --> 00:19:45,520
price trades below this low sorry not

341
00:19:45,520 --> 00:19:47,640
that

342
00:19:48,559 --> 00:19:52,000
one trades below this low and

343
00:19:52,000 --> 00:19:55,400
consequently below this low

344
00:19:57,120 --> 00:19:59,720
too this is where you end up having a

345
00:19:59,720 --> 00:20:03,000
move back into the previous range so

346
00:20:03,000 --> 00:20:05,840
there's uh 39 minutes left on that let

347
00:20:05,840 --> 00:20:07,720
me actually just look at what else we

348
00:20:07,720 --> 00:20:08,799
got

349
00:20:08,799 --> 00:20:11,679
here

350
00:20:11,679 --> 00:20:15,840
um yeah this is this is

351
00:20:18,159 --> 00:20:21,640
fine go to

352
00:20:23,559 --> 00:20:27,000
15 yeah this is

353
00:20:27,000 --> 00:20:30,480
fine f Bal they was trading back up and

354
00:20:30,480 --> 00:20:33,600
then putting a body below this uh low

355
00:20:33,600 --> 00:20:36,039
right here

356
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,640
431 should end up looking for these

357
00:20:39,640 --> 00:20:42,760
lows and tapping back into this

358
00:20:42,760 --> 00:20:46,440
um 4our fractal

359
00:20:46,440 --> 00:20:50,440
below so yeah that that's why you guys

360
00:20:50,440 --> 00:20:53,480
saw me with this this drawing in here

361
00:20:53,480 --> 00:20:55,000
first you saw the trend line Traders

362
00:20:55,000 --> 00:20:59,600
killing everybody they they be cooking

363
00:20:59,600 --> 00:21:02,000
they got their own system and and they

364
00:21:02,000 --> 00:21:04,080
be cooking y'all because y'all want to

365
00:21:04,080 --> 00:21:06,120
trade every detail in the

366
00:21:06,120 --> 00:21:09,080
market so yeah that that's

367
00:21:09,080 --> 00:21:12,880
essentially um what I have there's a

368
00:21:12,880 --> 00:21:16,600
possibility of another bounce

369
00:21:16,600 --> 00:21:18,960
406 uh but ultimately I want to see us

370
00:21:18,960 --> 00:21:23,440
get below that uh

371
00:21:27,000 --> 00:21:29,840
387 so I figured out I'll go through

372
00:21:29,840 --> 00:21:32,840
that

373
00:21:32,919 --> 00:21:37,919
um top down with y'all um just so you

374
00:21:37,919 --> 00:21:38,840
understand

375
00:21:38,840 --> 00:21:42,600
that we are not in the the environment

376
00:21:42,600 --> 00:21:46,039

and trade based on that stop holding

437
00:24:33,480 --> 00:24:35,720
positions that come back to

438
00:24:35,720 --> 00:24:39,520
you stop holding positions that you

439
00:24:39,520 --> 00:24:42,720
wanted to go further you wanted to run

440
00:24:42,720 --> 00:24:45,679
more and then it took everything it gave

441
00:24:45,679 --> 00:24:47,200
you from

442
00:24:47,200 --> 00:24:50,240
you stop doing

443
00:24:50,240 --> 00:24:53,640
that okay it's it's very important this

444
00:24:53,640 --> 00:24:55,480
Market is not made for

445
00:24:55,480 --> 00:24:57,960
us anybody that's on this live stream I

446
00:24:57,960 --> 00:25:00,880
promise you none of us have enough money

447
00:25:00,880 --> 00:25:02,640
to pick tops and bottoms in this market

448
00:25:02,640 --> 00:25:04,600
this Market hasn't been it's not made

449
00:25:04,600 --> 00:25:05,960
for

450
00:25:05,960 --> 00:25:09,399
us so if we can come in and take money

451
00:25:09,399 --> 00:25:12,279
out of thin air if we can come in and

452
00:25:12,279 --> 00:25:13,960
take money from somebody on the other

453
00:25:13,960 --> 00:25:16,880
side that's losing because their lack of

454
00:25:16,880 --> 00:25:18,880
self-discipline you know the the way the

455
00:25:18,880 --> 00:25:21,720
world works is those who manage risk

456
00:25:21,720 --> 00:25:23,799
take from those who

457
00:25:23,799 --> 00:25:26,320
don't so the same people in this market

458
00:25:26,320 --> 00:25:28,679
all trading together

459
00:25:28,679 --> 00:25:30,279
remember everybody talking about getting

460
00:25:30,279 --> 00:25:31,520
payouts and all that other stuff

461
00:25:31,520 --> 00:25:33,279
somebody lost their fees for you to get

462
00:25:33,279 --> 00:25:34,120
that

463
00:25:34,120 --> 00:25:36,559
payout somebody didn't exercise they

464
00:25:36,559 --> 00:25:41,279
risk on that somebody paid 50 $60,000 in

465
00:25:41,279 --> 00:25:46,760
payouts I mean in in fees in two three

466
00:25:46,760 --> 00:25:49,080
months in order for you to walk away

467
00:25:49,080 --> 00:25:51,320
with with that payout on the other

468
00:25:51,320 --> 00:25:57,279
side so those who manage risk take from

469
00:25:57,279 --> 00:26:00,240
those who do not

470
00:26:00,760 --> 00:26:03,480
and the sooner you understand that

471
00:26:03,480 --> 00:26:05,240
you'll see that you what what needs to

472
00:26:05,240 --> 00:26:07,200
be in your rules of Risk

473
00:26:07,200 --> 00:26:09,120
Management what needs to be in your

474
00:26:09,120 --> 00:26:13,480
rules of Risk Management right is paying

475
00:26:13,480 --> 00:26:15,440
yourself everybody has all these

476
00:26:15,440 --> 00:26:17,840
different rules of how to Trail a runner

477
00:26:17,840 --> 00:26:19,760
and how to do all of this but what about

478
00:26:19,760 --> 00:26:22,600
the rules of paying yourself when is it

479
00:26:22,600 --> 00:26:25,880
enough right you can make money on a

480
00:26:25,880 --> 00:26:28,720
move that you thought it was going

481
00:26:28,720 --> 00:26:30,440
further than that and you were wrong

482
00:26:30,440 --> 00:26:32,559
about that but you still made money with

483
00:26:32,559 --> 00:26:35,039
it you still made

484
00:26:35,039 --> 00:26:38,720
money you still able to protect your

485
00:26:38,720 --> 00:26:42,279
Capital so it's

486
00:26:42,279 --> 00:26:46,480
um you know important for y'all to

487
00:26:46,480 --> 00:26:49,600

00:27:11,279 --> 00:27:12,880
charts on Twitter all the time there was

497
00:27:12,880 --> 00:27:16,120
this one guy he you know had a position

498
00:27:16,120 --> 00:27:19,039
you know like that on on Euro USD he was

499
00:27:19,039 --> 00:27:21,559
aiming for 4 R you know some something

500
00:27:21,559 --> 00:27:23,520
like

501
00:27:23,520 --> 00:27:26,520
that he's aiming for hold I'm trying to

502
00:27:26,520 --> 00:27:29,559
there we go he's aiming for four

503
00:27:29,559 --> 00:27:33,919
I watch price get all the way up

504
00:27:33,919 --> 00:27:35,679
here

505
00:27:35,679 --> 00:27:39,080
right and see it come all the way back

506
00:27:39,080 --> 00:27:40,880
down

507
00:27:40,880 --> 00:27:43,519
here and his post

508
00:27:43,519 --> 00:27:46,519
was

509
00:27:46,760 --> 00:27:50,159
negative 1

510
00:27:54,240 --> 00:27:58,720
R1 R I'm sorry that that went almost

511
00:27:58,720 --> 00:28:01,120
three

512
00:28:01,279 --> 00:28:06,360
are and within your risk management

513
00:28:07,880 --> 00:28:13,320
approach because you weren't right about

514
00:28:13,320 --> 00:28:17,760
that this small little thing within this

515
00:28:17,760 --> 00:28:21,240
you allow yourself to give back all the

516
00:28:21,240 --> 00:28:23,320
profits and then go right back to your

517
00:28:23,320 --> 00:28:25,679
stop

518
00:28:26,480 --> 00:28:29,159
loss that that's the tax the the tax

519
00:28:29,159 --> 00:28:31,159
they pay they talking

520
00:28:31,159 --> 00:28:34,039
about that's that's not you didn't pay

521
00:28:34,039 --> 00:28:35,240
any

522
00:28:35,240 --> 00:28:39,840
tax you got to write off from your

523
00:28:40,000 --> 00:28:41,799
foolishness

524
00:28:41,799 --> 00:28:46,159
so in your in your your you know risk

525
00:28:46,159 --> 00:28:47,600
management

526
00:28:47,600 --> 00:28:51,120
approach just be sure that you guys are

527
00:28:51,120 --> 00:28:52,519
including

528
00:28:52,519 --> 00:28:56,279
that pay yourself lock something

529
00:28:56,279 --> 00:28:59,240
in this whole thing

530
00:28:59,240 --> 00:29:00,880
everything that we do

531
00:29:00,880 --> 00:29:03,559
here it's about paying

532
00:29:03,559 --> 00:29:07,000
yourself nothing else but paying

533
00:29:07,000 --> 00:29:10,039
yourself we don't come here to sing

534
00:29:10,039 --> 00:29:12,519
Kumbaya we don't come here to laugh and

535
00:29:12,519 --> 00:29:16,640
and and joke and and you know just waste

536
00:29:16,640 --> 00:29:18,320
away with our

537
00:29:18,320 --> 00:29:22,240
time and not monetize it you shouldn't

538
00:29:22,240 --> 00:29:23,559
be on social media if you're not making

539
00:29:23,559 --> 00:29:25,960
money and trading what are you doing

540
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:28,640
arguing with Joe Biden he even read

541
00:29:28,640 --> 00:29:29,880

00:29:29,880 --> 00:29:33,440
tweets what are you

543
00:29:37,519 --> 00:29:39,919

00:29:39,919 --> 00:29:42,519
yo it's just some crazy stuff you know

545
00:29:42,519 --> 00:29:44,159
so I want y'all to to get a little

546
00:29:44,159 --> 00:29:48,000
better with with um those

547
00:29:48,000 --> 00:29:49,840
techniques want you to get a little

548
00:29:49,840 --> 00:29:51,120
better with that let me look at what's

549
00:29:51,120 --> 00:29:54,399
on the the five second in there no they

550
00:29:54,399 --> 00:29:56,640
they still they still taking this down

551
00:29:56,640 --> 00:29:59,640
y'all

552
00:30:02,559 --> 00:30:04,039
yeah they still taking this down there's

553
00:30:04,039 --> 00:30:05,640
a little bounce out of

554
00:30:05,640 --> 00:30:08,399
this 5sec down candle but they still

555
00:30:08,399 --> 00:30:11,880
taking this down look at this like this

556
00:30:11,880 --> 00:30:13,200
this is this is how want you guys to

557
00:30:13,200 --> 00:30:14,600
frame

558
00:30:14,600 --> 00:30:18,320
it so this is going down like

559
00:30:18,320 --> 00:30:21,919
this like that

560
00:30:23,240 --> 00:30:25,600
right what you need

561
00:30:25,600 --> 00:30:29,960
is a manipulation down

562
00:30:30,080 --> 00:30:34,000
down up looks like they about to run it

563
00:30:34,000 --> 00:30:35,799
we'll see if they take out this High

564
00:30:35,799 --> 00:30:37,080
then more than likely they're going to

565
00:30:37,080 --> 00:30:39,919
go back to this

566
00:30:40,440 --> 00:30:45,720
here uh let me see there right

567
00:30:46,320 --> 00:30:48,840
there but they're running this down in a

568
00:30:48,840 --> 00:30:50,440
channel more than likely you get the

569
00:30:50,440 --> 00:30:52,559
manipulation below and price comes back

570
00:30:52,559 --> 00:30:56,279
up to take out these highs within it

571
00:30:56,279 --> 00:30:59,919
right so the only thing you want to keep

572
00:31:00,480 --> 00:31:03,399
is this up

573
00:31:04,360 --> 00:31:07,200
above when it makes that run back in the

574
00:31:07,200 --> 00:31:10,279
only thing that's worth shorting from is

575
00:31:10,279 --> 00:31:12,960
this up above not any of these highs

576
00:31:12,960 --> 00:31:14,799
within here that's for anybody to trade

577
00:31:14,799 --> 00:31:17,760
down on a second time

578
00:31:22,360 --> 00:31:26,360
frame so

579
00:31:30,840 --> 00:31:33,159
like I said we're going to hit this when

580
00:31:33,159 --> 00:31:35,080
the when the down

581
00:31:35,080 --> 00:31:38,080
candle trades into this

582
00:31:38,080 --> 00:31:41,399
Zone here when it trades into this

583
00:31:41,399 --> 00:31:43,159
depending on how far it

584
00:31:43,159 --> 00:31:48,240
goes that's where a nice little buy stop

585
00:31:48,240 --> 00:31:51,000
to trade back into the

586
00:31:51,000 --> 00:31:54,600
range comes from so Trail these down

587
00:31:54,600 --> 00:31:58,480
candle highs until you get in into this

588
00:31:58,480 --> 00:32:01,679
Zone and then you buy stop

589
00:32:01,679 --> 00:32:05,399
it and we watch price trade back up to

590
00:32:05,399 --> 00:32:07,480
take out some of these highs in here why

591
00:32:07,480 --> 00:32:09,399
because some of these highs in here are

592
00:32:09,399 --> 00:32:12,519
not a part of one minute

593
00:32:17,720 --> 00:32:21,440
structure and this is that that uh

594
00:32:21,440 --> 00:32:26,240
uh there's a 4H hour imbalance here as

595
00:32:26,240 --> 00:32:29,840
well as a 4-Hour fractal

596
00:32:45,679 --> 00:32:48,840
just moving this out the

597
00:32:53,840 --> 00:32:57,840
way oh

598
00:33:11,399 --> 00:33:14,000
SO trading is easy we

599
00:33:14,000 --> 00:33:18,159
just make it difficult uh weekly close

600
00:33:18,159 --> 00:33:21,720
do for OB think I do not speak the

601
00:33:21,720 --> 00:33:23,200
language at

602
00:33:23,200 --> 00:33:25,840
all I don't I don't know what you would

603
00:33:25,840 --> 00:33:28,200
you um

604
00:33:28,200 --> 00:33:30,240
do we have an interpreter here hold let

605
00:33:30,240 --> 00:33:31,519
me see if I can find

606
00:33:31,519 --> 00:33:34,000
one do we get do we got an interpreter

607
00:33:34,000 --> 00:33:38,600
y'all we got we need somebody to speak

608
00:33:38,600 --> 00:33:41,590
cby I going to try

609
00:33:41,590 --> 00:33:44,519
[Music]

610
00:33:44,519 --> 00:33:47,080
to

611
00:33:47,080 --> 00:33:51,200
yeah we get CBA in

612
00:33:51,200 --> 00:33:53,919
here do

613
00:33:53,919 --> 00:33:57,880
weekly close

614
00:33:57,880 --> 00:34:00,000
4 h

615
00:34:00,000 --> 00:34:01,799
o yeah

616
00:34:01,799 --> 00:34:05,480
I you you gonna have to you got to wait

617
00:34:05,480 --> 00:34:07,200
till somebody in the

618
00:34:07,200 --> 00:34:08,760
chat

619
00:34:08,760 --> 00:34:14,480
uh in chat helps me out with that one

620
00:34:14,480 --> 00:34:16,760
because

621
00:34:16,760 --> 00:34:20,040
I I want to serve you the best that I

622
00:34:20,040 --> 00:34:24,079
can you know but there's a language

623
00:34:24,079 --> 00:34:27,839
barrier there

624
00:34:30,918 --> 00:34:33,000
it's going to be difficult so so look

625
00:34:33,000 --> 00:34:34,440
guys

626
00:34:34,440 --> 00:34:36,960
look we have that lower time we're

627
00:34:36,960 --> 00:34:39,199
talking about lower time frame swings

628
00:34:39,199 --> 00:34:41,359
right we have that one there we have

629
00:34:41,359 --> 00:34:43,520
another one there we have another one

630
00:34:43,520 --> 00:34:46,719
there we have another one there we have

631
00:34:46,719 --> 00:34:51,760
another one there so we have

632
00:34:51,760 --> 00:34:55,119
these lower time frame

633
00:34:55,119 --> 00:34:59,119
Swings with

634
00:35:00,680 --> 00:35:03,839
these higher time

635
00:35:03,839 --> 00:35:08,079
frame lows and highs right there right

636
00:35:08,079 --> 00:35:10,160
another low here putting another high

637
00:35:10,160 --> 00:35:13,839
right trade below it give us a body so

638
00:35:13,839 --> 00:35:18,960
we're looking for another higher time

639
00:35:18,960 --> 00:35:21,880
frame uh um

640
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:27,960
pullback as a third um high in order so

641
00:35:27,960 --> 00:35:31,000
what still bring us back

642
00:35:31,000 --> 00:35:35,119
below so we're still

643
00:35:35,119 --> 00:35:38,079
anticipating that pric is looking to

644
00:35:38,079 --> 00:35:42,119
trade lower than where we currently are

645
00:35:42,119 --> 00:35:44,440
we just don't want to be shorting at the

646
00:35:44,440 --> 00:35:47,640
time that price is pulling

647
00:35:47,640 --> 00:35:51,359
back we want to make sure that we're you

648
00:35:51,359 --> 00:35:54,319
know staying on the side of when price

649
00:35:54,319 --> 00:35:58,280
is going to do what there there's people

650
00:35:58,280 --> 00:36:01,400
there people that what they do is they

651
00:36:01,400 --> 00:36:04,319
go short here and price pulls up 84

652
00:36:04,319 --> 00:36:07,040
points on them they go short here and

653
00:36:07,040 --> 00:36:10,119
price pulls up 84 points on them or 80

654
00:36:10,119 --> 00:36:12,520
points on them so you just want to make

655
00:36:12,520 --> 00:36:15,760
sure that you're not

656
00:36:15,760 --> 00:36:20,839
um shorting at certain lows that prices

657
00:36:20,839 --> 00:36:23,280
getting ready to pull back you know

658
00:36:23,280 --> 00:36:25,680
within

659
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,640
that so that's why I have us now we the

660
00:36:29,640 --> 00:36:34,560
50% of the uh the fractal

661
00:36:36,520 --> 00:36:40,920
there we more than likely

662
00:36:42,839 --> 00:36:45,599
uh I'm thinking we deliver a one to one

663
00:36:45,599 --> 00:36:48,000
on it

664
00:36:48,000 --> 00:36:51,520
but we'll just

665
00:36:53,319 --> 00:36:55,560
wait oh you supposed to be vortexing

666
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:57,720
right now

667
00:36:57,720 --> 00:36:59,200
Hi D when is the back next back to

668
00:36:59,200 --> 00:37:00,920
membership I don't I don't I'm not sure

669
00:37:00,920 --> 00:37:03,760
I don't know I'm not

670
00:37:03,760 --> 00:37:06,760
sure

671
00:37:06,839 --> 00:37:09,359
um the the one that I'm working on now

672
00:37:09,359 --> 00:37:12,359
it's a tougher group

673
00:37:12,359 --> 00:37:16,079
um you know I'm trying to make sure that

674
00:37:16,079 --> 00:37:18,079
they uh

675
00:37:18,079 --> 00:37:20,760
uh you know sort of get what they need

676
00:37:20,760 --> 00:37:23,520
to so when the next group comes in there

677
00:37:23,520 --> 00:37:27,119
are other people there that's able to um

678
00:37:27,119 --> 00:37:28,400
give them them a

679
00:37:28,400 --> 00:37:32,720
hand on uh uh you know what's needed I

680
00:37:32,720 --> 00:37:34,240
mean you got to think about it I'm one

681
00:37:34,240 --> 00:37:37,560
person like you even look at Sam's group

682
00:37:37,560 --> 00:37:40,400
you know profitable losers group I'm

683
00:37:40,400 --> 00:37:43,880
more than sure that you know as many

684
00:37:43,880 --> 00:37:45,960
people as in his group he's not able to

685
00:37:45,960 --> 00:37:48,760
really answer the question that everyone

686
00:37:48,760 --> 00:37:51,240
has not able to serve everybody not able

687
00:37:51,240 --> 00:37:55,560
to you know do certain things you know

688
00:37:55,560 --> 00:37:59,400
that that he wants to with every single

689
00:37:59,400 --> 00:38:01,839
individual because it's just a lot of

690
00:38:01,839 --> 00:38:05,800
people and it's one person you know um

691
00:38:05,800 --> 00:38:06,880
Dave are you still looking for people to

692
00:38:06,880 --> 00:38:09,440
hire yes yes I am um yes I'm going to

693
00:38:09,440 --> 00:38:12,079
put that application out

694
00:38:12,079 --> 00:38:16,079
soon yes

695
00:38:35,560 --> 00:38:36,880
uh there's people in the class who lie

696
00:38:36,880 --> 00:38:39,240
about watching the free playlist I mean

697
00:38:39,240 --> 00:38:41,000
I I think that's everywhere you know

698
00:38:41,000 --> 00:38:44,960
like I remember one guy um coming to me

699
00:38:44,960 --> 00:38:46,720
and telling me that profitable loser

700
00:38:46,720 --> 00:38:49,040
strategy doesn't work and I was like

701
00:38:49,040 --> 00:38:50,960
well did you back test it and he goes

702
00:38:50,960 --> 00:38:52,440
well that's just

703
00:38:52,440 --> 00:38:57,640
icts and dog like first of all

704
00:38:57,640 --> 00:39:00,920
we don't allow pets in here there's no

705
00:39:00,920 --> 00:39:02,079
pet

706
00:39:02,079 --> 00:39:05,520
policy so the the end

707
00:39:05,520 --> 00:39:11,079
dog the the you know the hogw whatever

708
00:39:11,079 --> 00:39:12,560
all all the animals you want to talk

709
00:39:12,560 --> 00:39:15,839
about we we don't allow that in here but

710
00:39:15,839 --> 00:39:20,800
what you have to do is that you have

711
00:39:20,800 --> 00:39:24,200
to back test no matter what it is that

712
00:39:24,200 --> 00:39:27,160
somebody tells you you have to back test

713
00:39:27,160 --> 00:39:28,720
it

714
00:39:28,720 --> 00:39:33,560
period you have to back test it know if

715
00:39:33,560 --> 00:39:38,400
ands or butt you have to back test it

716
00:39:38,400 --> 00:39:44,040
it's not possible to you know be able to

717
00:39:44,040 --> 00:39:46,760
get any of this knowledge that we have

718
00:39:46,760 --> 00:39:48,960
transferred to you so you could apply in

719
00:39:48,960 --> 00:39:51,200
the proper context if you have not back

720
00:39:51,200 --> 00:39:54,160
tested it there's no

721
00:39:54,160 --> 00:39:56,200
way so you got to make sure that you

722
00:39:56,200 --> 00:39:59,319
back test period

723
00:39:59,480 --> 00:40:01,440
no matter who you're learning from

724
00:40:01,440 --> 00:40:02,920
you're never going to learn one thing

725
00:40:02,920 --> 00:40:04,920
that's going to be the holy grail for

726
00:40:04,920 --> 00:40:08,720
you so let me move this

727
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,720
here

728
00:40:12,760 --> 00:40:16,319
um that Spike up that I'm looking for at

729
00:40:16,319 --> 00:40:18,920
least is going to go above

730
00:40:18,920 --> 00:40:23,560
this uh 407

731
00:40:24,960 --> 00:40:29,319
there so what you want to see is

732
00:40:30,240 --> 00:40:32,760
just that first candle that closes up

733
00:40:32,760 --> 00:40:36,560
above and leaves that

734
00:40:36,560 --> 00:40:39,560
imbalance behind like

735
00:40:39,560 --> 00:40:42,240
that yeah leaves that imbalance behind

736
00:40:42,240 --> 00:40:45,119
so we're at what is it we hit 10:30 yet

737
00:40:45,119 --> 00:40:48,520
nope 10:30 is the next

738
00:40:49,880 --> 00:40:51,920
candle so you want to see a bullish

739
00:40:51,920 --> 00:40:53,520
candle

740
00:40:53,520 --> 00:40:56,599
run take out a previous candle's High

741
00:40:56,599 --> 00:40:58,000
close

742
00:40:58,000 --> 00:41:00,760
but then you want to see some

743
00:41:00,760 --> 00:41:06,000
imbalances um start to form so

744
00:41:06,000 --> 00:41:10,520
this it could be one of those highs

745
00:41:11,280 --> 00:41:14,880
there that we should be looking to push

746
00:41:14,880 --> 00:41:16,960
if you can get a body closure above here

747
00:41:16,960 --> 00:41:21,960
the next candle opens Taps into it and

748
00:41:21,960 --> 00:41:25,040
then runs higher and covers this entire

749
00:41:25,040 --> 00:41:28,880
imbalance and I'm think of 405 is where

750
00:41:28,880 --> 00:41:30,839
it's looking

751
00:41:30,839 --> 00:41:33,280
for right now we traded directly through

752
00:41:33,280 --> 00:41:36,079
the fractal that's fine um we didn't get

753
00:41:36,079 --> 00:41:38,680
a closure until we got below the low of

754
00:41:38,680 --> 00:41:40,520
the fractal see this here pushing up

755
00:41:40,520 --> 00:41:43,760
like that you want to see a run back up

756
00:41:43,760 --> 00:41:47,440
to this High here at

757
00:41:47,760 --> 00:41:50,200
405 and again you're not shorting out of

758
00:41:50,200 --> 00:41:52,920
any of this stuff here because this is

759
00:41:52,920 --> 00:41:57,920
all um not a part of structure

760
00:41:59,280 --> 00:42:03,560
so nice yep yep that that's

761
00:42:03,560 --> 00:42:07,400
it that's what we're looking

762
00:42:08,680 --> 00:42:12,960
for hey BR you enjoy you

763
00:42:17,720 --> 00:42:19,800
enjoy Dave can you show a video on how

764
00:42:19,800 --> 00:42:24,440
to back this the last live stream I did

765
00:42:34,760 --> 00:42:37,240
nice yeah go to go to the last live

766
00:42:37,240 --> 00:42:41,960
stream I um I explained how to back

767
00:42:41,960 --> 00:42:44,559
test but the truth is you should just be

768
00:42:44,559 --> 00:42:47,000
back testing the concepts you you've

769
00:42:47,000 --> 00:42:49,760
learned back test them each session

770
00:42:49,760 --> 00:42:51,160
whatever session you're going to trade

771
00:42:51,160 --> 00:42:55,559
from back test it back test the concept

772
00:42:55,559 --> 00:42:58,920
that you're using

773
00:43:07,720 --> 00:43:10,280
so like I said it should be trading up

774
00:43:10,280 --> 00:43:13,480
above this High

775
00:43:13,720 --> 00:43:17,200
here um with this little tiny fractal

776
00:43:17,200 --> 00:43:19,119
that if we do pull back before it we

777
00:43:19,119 --> 00:43:20,359
could sit

778
00:43:20,359 --> 00:43:24,319
on well there goes a high

779
00:43:24,440 --> 00:43:26,920
now would you more than likely see us do

780
00:43:26,920 --> 00:43:29,800
is take this low right here it happens

781
00:43:29,800 --> 00:43:31,280
that it's imbalance and we know the

782
00:43:31,280 --> 00:43:32,440
first

783
00:43:32,440 --> 00:43:36,200
imbalance puts in another high so you

784
00:43:36,200 --> 00:43:37,680
want to see this close leave that

785
00:43:37,680 --> 00:43:39,760
imbalance open tap back into this

786
00:43:39,760 --> 00:43:42,079
imbalance maybe more or less nearest to

787
00:43:42,079 --> 00:43:44,760
the fractal and then I have another

788
00:43:44,760 --> 00:43:47,760
pushup

789
00:44:01,920 --> 00:44:06,160
got an entry at 17344

790
00:44:13,119 --> 00:44:19,440
beautiful Z in nearest to the fractal

791
00:44:32,079 --> 00:44:33,920
it gets back into this Wick here you

792
00:44:33,920 --> 00:44:35,680
just want to be sure that we don't fail

793
00:44:35,680 --> 00:44:37,800
in here if we end up failing in here

794
00:44:37,800 --> 00:44:39,920
that ends up being a double top in there

795
00:44:39,920 --> 00:44:42,280
that could bring us below this fractal

796
00:44:42,280 --> 00:44:45,400
and then back into that

797
00:44:46,800 --> 00:44:50,200
range so there's

798
00:44:50,200 --> 00:44:54,880
that IM balance top

799
00:45:08,800 --> 00:45:10,240
you know it's funny that this is how

800
00:45:10,240 --> 00:45:12,119
people want to watch

801
00:45:12,119 --> 00:45:15,760
price you know with like all of

802
00:45:15,760 --> 00:45:20,000
this you know uh

803
00:45:20,000 --> 00:45:23,200
uh silence and stuff and I'm just like

804
00:45:23,200 --> 00:45:25,960
you know I get it you you might need to

805
00:45:25,960 --> 00:45:27,640
concentrate you know while you're

806
00:45:27,640 --> 00:45:29,000
trading or while you're pushing a button

807
00:45:29,000 --> 00:45:30,599
and all of that but I've pushed a button

808
00:45:30,599 --> 00:45:31,440
so

809
00:45:31,440 --> 00:45:36,760
much I've watched price so much I've you

810
00:45:36,760 --> 00:45:38,000
know

811
00:45:38,000 --> 00:45:42,440
just engag with it way more than than

812
00:45:42,440 --> 00:45:45,640
you know I've play video games and and

813
00:45:45,640 --> 00:45:47,559
that I've studied other things i' I've

814
00:45:47,559 --> 00:45:48,760
done

815
00:45:48,760 --> 00:45:54,400
so much as it relates to price that I

816
00:45:54,400 --> 00:45:57,319
can be distracted by things I can read

817
00:45:57,319 --> 00:45:59,839
the chat while I'm trading and looking

818
00:45:59,839 --> 00:46:02,640
at Price calling it and listening to

819
00:46:02,640 --> 00:46:05,480
music and checking notification real

820
00:46:05,480 --> 00:46:07,280
quick all of these different things I

821
00:46:07,280 --> 00:46:08,480
can

822
00:46:08,480 --> 00:46:13,680
do because I've done this part of it so

823
00:46:13,680 --> 00:46:16,680
much that's where back testing comes in

824
00:46:16,680 --> 00:46:21,079
some people believe that that you know

825
00:46:21,079 --> 00:46:25,119
if if you uh

826
00:46:25,119 --> 00:46:27,640
uh if you don't back test you could

827
00:46:27,640 --> 00:46:29,520
still make it you could still you need

828
00:46:29,520 --> 00:46:31,680
the real experience you know all of that

829
00:46:31,680 --> 00:46:34,240
other St you need the real experience

830
00:46:34,240 --> 00:46:36,839
none of that is true back testing gives

831
00:46:36,839 --> 00:46:39,559
you the real experience guess what that

832
00:46:39,559 --> 00:46:41,200
same area that you're going through in

833
00:46:41,200 --> 00:46:43,480
back testing somebody got

834
00:46:43,480 --> 00:46:46,760
cooked somebody got

835
00:46:46,760 --> 00:46:50,079
smoked in that same area that you're

836
00:46:50,079 --> 00:46:52,839
back there looking at somebody somebody

837
00:46:52,839 --> 00:46:55,839
got hog washed in this

838
00:46:55,839 --> 00:46:59,079
drop from this high all the way down to

839
00:46:59,079 --> 00:47:03,720
here somebody got smoked thinking

840
00:47:03,720 --> 00:47:06,520
that they were in that move to be the

841
00:47:06,520 --> 00:47:09,440
first people going

842
00:47:10,640 --> 00:47:13,599
up has this happened before yes plenty

843
00:47:13,599 --> 00:47:14,720
of

844
00:47:14,720 --> 00:47:18,559
times plenty of

845
00:47:18,559 --> 00:47:21,359
times so you see what I said so if we

846
00:47:21,359 --> 00:47:23,040
get caught in this Wick we can trade

847
00:47:23,040 --> 00:47:24,920
back into this Wick if we end up getting

848
00:47:24,920 --> 00:47:26,119
stuck in this Wick it's going to come

849
00:47:26,119 --> 00:47:28,160
for the low of the this fractal right

850
00:47:28,160 --> 00:47:29,920
here so you see the low of the fractal

851
00:47:29,920 --> 00:47:32,599
taken

852
00:47:32,800 --> 00:47:35,000
right nice little bounce off of it but

853
00:47:35,000 --> 00:47:36,400
the low of the fractal

854
00:47:36,400 --> 00:47:39,400
taken

855
00:47:42,000 --> 00:47:45,319
now we're

856
00:47:45,640 --> 00:47:49,040
in this down move

857
00:47:49,040 --> 00:47:51,079
here more than likely what you want to

858
00:47:51,079 --> 00:47:53,800
see is let's take the low of that candle

859
00:47:53,800 --> 00:47:57,240
that just closed

860
00:48:00,520 --> 00:48:03,119
tap into this Zone and pop back the

861
00:48:03,119 --> 00:48:05,079
other

862
00:48:05,079 --> 00:48:07,240
way and this is why I talk about if

863
00:48:07,240 --> 00:48:10,960
there's two imbalances after a high is

864
00:48:10,960 --> 00:48:13,000
taken you don't want to consider the

865
00:48:13,000 --> 00:48:14,559
first one you want to consider the next

866
00:48:14,559 --> 00:48:17,680
the the second one nearest to the snd so

867
00:48:17,680 --> 00:48:19,920
this imbalance here you know did give a

868
00:48:19,920 --> 00:48:23,160
nice little pop off of it you know nice

869
00:48:23,160 --> 00:48:26,800
little uh 18-point move off of it um but

870
00:48:26,800 --> 00:48:29,359
I don't trade IM balances anymore I only

871
00:48:29,359 --> 00:48:30,640
trade

872
00:48:30,640 --> 00:48:34,240
utilizing um uh structure zones so what

873
00:48:34,240 --> 00:48:37,200
this is if you guys um watch that video

874
00:48:37,200 --> 00:48:39,280
on Candlestick structure what this is is

875
00:48:39,280 --> 00:48:41,119
that's the high that's the low put in we

876
00:48:41,119 --> 00:48:44,920
traded up Above This Is Us trading back

877
00:48:44,920 --> 00:48:49,160
into that Candlestick structure

878
00:48:49,160 --> 00:48:52,559
flip so that's the only reason why I

879
00:48:52,559 --> 00:48:55,079
would be looking for that low to get

880
00:48:55,079 --> 00:48:59,000
taken out and us going back into this

881
00:49:06,520 --> 00:49:10,079
Z and if we

882
00:49:12,160 --> 00:49:16,400
can get that down candle that pushes in

883
00:49:16,400 --> 00:49:20,640
there you might end up being able

884
00:49:20,640 --> 00:49:25,520
to buy stop back into

885
00:49:29,200 --> 00:49:32,319
sorry back into the

886
00:49:33,880 --> 00:49:37,200
wick up

887
00:49:43,920 --> 00:49:48,480
there so that moves further down into

888
00:49:55,319 --> 00:49:57,440
it I don't know how youall like this

889
00:49:57,440 --> 00:49:59,079
with no

890
00:49:59,079 --> 00:50:01,440
music I figured I'd come out and try

891
00:50:01,440 --> 00:50:02,640
this

892
00:50:02,640 --> 00:50:06,799
but this is just

893
00:50:06,799 --> 00:50:08,880
agonizing guess some people ain't there

894
00:50:08,880 --> 00:50:11,040
yet we they able to just hear noises why

895
00:50:11,040 --> 00:50:13,640
they why they

896
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,319
trading so that's what a successful

897
00:50:20,319 --> 00:50:23,119
candles stick structure flip looks

898
00:50:23,119 --> 00:50:26,400
like we take out that high we trade back

899
00:50:26,400 --> 00:50:28,960
into The Zone and we push back I don't

900
00:50:28,960 --> 00:50:30,880
think we quite delivered the one to one

901
00:50:30,880 --> 00:50:34,480
as of yet um but you see that move right

902
00:50:34,480 --> 00:50:37,400
into the 50% of it and we get that

903
00:50:37,400 --> 00:50:39,799
little push out heading back here the

904
00:50:39,799 --> 00:50:42,040
people who buy stop if we don't trade up

905
00:50:42,040 --> 00:50:44,680
above this down candle High then you're

906
00:50:44,680 --> 00:50:47,440
safe should we end up taking this low

907
00:50:47,440 --> 00:50:49,440
then you know that's something that you

908
00:50:49,440 --> 00:50:51,760
were able to escape without having to

909
00:50:51,760 --> 00:50:53,799
utilize you could move that by stop down

910
00:50:53,799 --> 00:50:55,359
to here

911
00:50:55,359 --> 00:50:59,119
now down to this

912
00:51:20,559 --> 00:51:23,480
high and for me pretty much the the way

913
00:51:23,480 --> 00:51:27,200
that I um

914
00:51:27,200 --> 00:51:31,359
approach prices uh on sweeps

915
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:36,520
so if they left a wick behind here and

916
00:51:36,520 --> 00:51:39,359
then trade it back below I would be a

917
00:51:39,359 --> 00:51:42,359
part of the move that goes below here

918
00:51:42,359 --> 00:51:46,000
and goes back up for the wick

919
00:51:46,000 --> 00:51:50,599
there so this is not um uh this is an

920
00:51:50,599 --> 00:51:52,079
entry that a lot of people may take

921
00:51:52,079 --> 00:51:55,880
that's fine this is just not one that um

922
00:51:55,880 --> 00:51:59,200
I particular ly uh utilize I pretty much

923
00:51:59,200 --> 00:52:04,079
wait for the sweep and then uh trade

924
00:52:04,400 --> 00:52:07,040
higher but there's the oneto one

925
00:52:07,040 --> 00:52:10,839
delivery uh coming into play bam right

926
00:52:10,839 --> 00:52:12,880
there you

927
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,680
see now the people who got activated in

928
00:52:15,680 --> 00:52:18,720
their buy stop

929
00:52:19,559 --> 00:52:21,359
here this

930
00:52:21,359 --> 00:52:24,160
is smaller Candlestick structure flip

931
00:52:24,160 --> 00:52:25,319
within

932
00:52:25,319 --> 00:52:28,680
here with with this low into this High

933
00:52:28,680 --> 00:52:30,799
then we shift below then we trade out so

934
00:52:30,799 --> 00:52:34,040
now we're back into there for that

935
00:52:34,040 --> 00:52:37,280
confirmation one I don't do confirmation

936
00:52:37,280 --> 00:52:39,799
entries in

937
00:52:39,799 --> 00:52:43,720
downtrends because I'm expecting often

938
00:52:43,720 --> 00:52:48,240
times a sweep of that but being that

939
00:52:48,240 --> 00:52:49,520
this could just

940
00:52:49,520 --> 00:52:52,760
be equal low here that runs back for

941
00:52:52,760 --> 00:52:56,680
this High and the high of that zone too

942
00:52:56,680 --> 00:52:58,920
that's the only reason why I would even

943
00:52:58,920 --> 00:53:02,720
be you know marking something out like

944
00:53:02,720 --> 00:53:06,559
this but that's the entries I choose to

945
00:53:06,559 --> 00:53:10,640
take versus the the um group of entries

946
00:53:10,640 --> 00:53:13,119
that I teach so you see why I talk about

947
00:53:13,119 --> 00:53:16,400
the one: one being something that you

948
00:53:16,400 --> 00:53:18,520
know you should consider because look at

949
00:53:18,520 --> 00:53:21,079
what happens right after the one: one we

950
00:53:21,079 --> 00:53:24,440
deliver the one to one right and then

951
00:53:24,440 --> 00:53:27,760
you see a move back into the range of it

952
00:53:27,760 --> 00:53:30,760
so if you traded from here to the one to

953
00:53:30,760 --> 00:53:33,520
one and you were able to cut on that I

954
00:53:33,520 --> 00:53:35,119
know a lot of people a lot of people are

955
00:53:35,119 --> 00:53:36,720
like oh these are small moves no they're

956
00:53:36,720 --> 00:53:40,960
not this is this is almost 15 points

957
00:53:40,960 --> 00:53:42,440
that you get in a push coming out of

958
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:44,880
there like

959
00:53:45,640 --> 00:53:48,440
that almost 15 points when when they

960
00:53:48,440 --> 00:53:51,760
Mentor I says five handles for Life he's

961
00:53:51,760 --> 00:53:55,520
talking about Five Points

962
00:54:00,400 --> 00:54:04,280
so these moves are not small you can pay

963
00:54:04,280 --> 00:54:06,599
yourself with things like this look this

964
00:54:06,599 --> 00:54:11,040
is that that uh uh Candlestick structure

965
00:54:11,040 --> 00:54:12,680
move in

966
00:54:12,680 --> 00:54:15,440
here that I mentioned see it pushing

967
00:54:15,440 --> 00:54:18,000
back out like that

968
00:54:18,000 --> 00:54:20,559
again now why am I looking on this side

969
00:54:20,559 --> 00:54:22,400
and why am I not talking

970
00:54:22,400 --> 00:54:25,559
about the Zone that's here why am I not

971
00:54:25,559 --> 00:54:26,960
talking about that

972
00:54:26,960 --> 00:54:28,319
the one to the left why am we not

973
00:54:28,319 --> 00:54:30,559
talking about finding a short way to go

974
00:54:30,559 --> 00:54:32,760
back

975
00:54:34,000 --> 00:54:37,000
below

976
00:54:37,280 --> 00:54:40,880
because what occurred here and how I

977
00:54:40,880 --> 00:54:42,520
mentioned that you want to see those

978
00:54:42,520 --> 00:54:45,240
imbalances forming as we're pushing up

979
00:54:45,240 --> 00:54:48,160
right so it trades back to the origin of

980
00:54:48,160 --> 00:54:52,280
that move and that's the origin of this

981
00:54:52,280 --> 00:54:55,000
push coming out so if there's anything

982
00:54:55,000 --> 00:54:57,040
in there again

983
00:54:57,040 --> 00:55:01,240
for for price to you know move us higher

984
00:55:01,240 --> 00:55:03,480
it would come out of this point of

985
00:55:03,480 --> 00:55:07,040
Interest here and as we mentioned we

986
00:55:07,040 --> 00:55:09,799
could see us go back up to

987
00:55:09,799 --> 00:55:14,040
what that Wick that's above there and

988
00:55:14,040 --> 00:55:17,319
what that would show us

989
00:55:19,680 --> 00:55:22,520
is that there's a low there and there's

990
00:55:22,520 --> 00:55:24,799
a low there and we look to Target that

991
00:55:24,799 --> 00:55:26,440
high and potentially the high of the

992
00:55:26,440 --> 00:55:28,640
Zone because that zone when we went back

993
00:55:28,640 --> 00:55:30,880
up and tapped into it it didn't give us

994
00:55:30,880 --> 00:55:33,880
a new low so that ends up rendering this

995
00:55:33,880 --> 00:55:36,640
Zone within here a weak Zone well it

996
00:55:36,640 --> 00:55:39,039
could it could be you know that that

997
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:42,960
zone there or potentially this uh up

998
00:55:42,960 --> 00:55:46,000
move here as well so you you might get

999
00:55:46,000 --> 00:55:48,359
another rejection you know somewhere

1000
00:55:48,359 --> 00:55:51,359
around here but it could end up looking

1001
00:55:51,359 --> 00:55:55,240
for the high of that now how many

1002
00:55:55,240 --> 00:55:57,760
entries can I find

1003
00:55:57,760 --> 00:56:00,799
within something like

1004
00:56:01,200 --> 00:56:03,839
this how many Ines can I

1005
00:56:03,839 --> 00:56:06,480
find taking trades off that the first

1006
00:56:06,480 --> 00:56:09,400
buy stop that pushed up there right the

1007
00:56:09,400 --> 00:56:12,160
second buy stop on the confirmation that

1008
00:56:12,160 --> 00:56:13,839
moved up there right the little tap into

1009
00:56:13,839 --> 00:56:15,920
the imbalance take a couple points off

1010
00:56:15,920 --> 00:56:20,799
of it saw it you know uh uh fail there

1011
00:56:20,799 --> 00:56:23,079
and then take the low of the fractal

1012
00:56:23,079 --> 00:56:27,359
does not mean we're going lower

1013
00:56:27,799 --> 00:56:30,799
does not mean we're going

1014
00:56:32,799 --> 00:56:35,760
lower we know we returned to the origin

1015
00:56:35,760 --> 00:56:38,319
of that move up now I don't know what's

1016
00:56:38,319 --> 00:56:39,880
to the left I don't know if we're

1017
00:56:39,880 --> 00:56:42,640
bouncing out something to the left then

1018
00:56:42,640 --> 00:56:44,760
the you know there could be some

1019
00:56:44,760 --> 00:56:46,680
imbalance there there could be some 4H

1020
00:56:46,680 --> 00:56:48,079
hour down candle I don't know I don't

1021
00:56:48,079 --> 00:56:49,480
know what's

1022
00:56:49,480 --> 00:56:53,079
there but it's based on what you see

1023
00:56:53,079 --> 00:56:55,240
price doing now what's the first thing

1024
00:56:55,240 --> 00:56:57,240
that I did

1025
00:56:57,240 --> 00:56:59,440
when we began to

1026
00:56:59,440 --> 00:57:04,200
talk you guys heard me count the swings

1027
00:57:07,079 --> 00:57:10,039
right so by the fifth swing I was done

1028
00:57:10,039 --> 00:57:12,200
looking for continuations and now was

1029
00:57:12,200 --> 00:57:15,119
looking to be on the long side the six

1030
00:57:15,119 --> 00:57:17,680
swing we traded up above it no over here

1031
00:57:17,680 --> 00:57:20,400
we traded up above it right and then we

1032
00:57:20,400 --> 00:57:23,240
came back below it that doesn't

1033
00:57:23,240 --> 00:57:27,559
mean that you're wrong

1034
00:57:27,559 --> 00:57:28,480
that just means that there's a

1035
00:57:28,480 --> 00:57:30,480
possibility that you're early but guess

1036
00:57:30,480 --> 00:57:34,559
what the algorithm will still do exactly

1037
00:57:34,559 --> 00:57:38,119
what it is scripted to

1038
00:57:38,440 --> 00:57:42,640
do whether you were early or

1039
00:57:44,319 --> 00:57:48,119
not it would still do

1040
00:57:52,119 --> 00:57:54,760
that so you may have people wanting

1041
00:57:54,760 --> 00:57:56,359
lower

1042
00:57:56,359 --> 00:57:59,760
tell you take out the high of that zone

1043
00:58:02,400 --> 00:58:05,799
right particularly this one two I was

1044
00:58:05,799 --> 00:58:08,520
seeing at first this this uh the high of

1045
00:58:08,520 --> 00:58:09,680
this but like I mentioned there could be

1046
00:58:09,680 --> 00:58:13,520
another rejection here before taking

1047
00:58:13,680 --> 00:58:16,480
it

1048
00:58:16,480 --> 00:58:19,359
so trading literally is about what

1049
00:58:19,359 --> 00:58:22,359
what's the first thing that I

1050
00:58:22,599 --> 00:58:25,720
noted oh well well 10 10:30 is the next

1051
00:58:25,720 --> 00:58:27,039
candle

1052
00:58:27,039 --> 00:58:29,079
10 10:30 all right next count is going

1053
00:58:29,079 --> 00:58:30,160
to be

1054
00:58:30,160 --> 00:58:32,359
10:30 youall hear how the first part of

1055
00:58:32,359 --> 00:58:36,319
the trading plan was

1056
00:58:37,319 --> 00:58:40,760
created no trades before

1057
00:58:40,760 --> 00:58:43,799
10:30 looking at all that's occurring

1058
00:58:43,799 --> 00:58:46,200
even if we don't start trading before

1059
00:58:46,200 --> 00:58:50,280
10:30 we begin to look at what has

1060
00:58:50,280 --> 00:58:52,960
occurred prior to

1061
00:58:52,960 --> 00:58:55,599
that then we saw that equal low there we

1062
00:58:55,599 --> 00:58:57,559
go okay yeah these are not areas to

1063
00:58:57,559 --> 00:59:00,359
Short from here because we're going to

1064
00:59:00,359 --> 00:59:02,760
end up going up above this high so that

1065
00:59:02,760 --> 00:59:05,079
means you rule out any small fractal

1066
00:59:05,079 --> 00:59:06,760
you're choosing inside of there any

1067
00:59:06,760 --> 00:59:08,760
small snd you have on the lower time

1068
00:59:08,760 --> 00:59:10,760
frame there you're ruling that out so

1069
00:59:10,760 --> 00:59:14,720
you don't get cooked by those little

1070
00:59:15,400 --> 00:59:17,559
losses we said there' be another

1071
00:59:17,559 --> 00:59:20,920
rejection inside of here

1072
00:59:22,760 --> 00:59:25,240
right all of these things can be

1073
00:59:25,240 --> 00:59:26,839
followed

1074
00:59:26,839 --> 00:59:30,680
can be followed can be

1075
00:59:33,880 --> 00:59:39,039
predicted the problem is a lot of the

1076
00:59:39,079 --> 00:59:42,480
times we're zoomed in like

1077
00:59:42,480 --> 00:59:46,039
this we see a large candle come down oh

1078
00:59:46,039 --> 00:59:50,119
my goodness oh it's happening Black Swan

1079
00:59:50,119 --> 00:59:56,520
is is H is happening y oh oh my is it's

1080
00:59:56,520 --> 00:59:58,880
this

1081
00:59:59,079 --> 01:00:01,480
happening is is getting ready to take

1082
01:00:01,480 --> 01:00:03,200
place y'all I'm telling

1083
01:00:03,200 --> 01:00:05,960
you you better hold on to your wigs I'm

1084
01:00:05,960 --> 01:00:07,400
tell

1085
01:00:07,400 --> 01:00:11,880
this why are we so zoomed in that

1086
01:00:11,880 --> 01:00:15,440
close not understanding where these

1087
01:00:15,440 --> 01:00:19,920
different things are coming

1088
01:00:20,480 --> 01:00:24,280
from where they taking

1089
01:00:24,599 --> 01:00:28,440
place and we just follow price that's it

1090
01:00:28,440 --> 01:00:31,839
so our money is not in chasing price

1091
01:00:31,839 --> 01:00:34,760
higher our money is in getting a

1092
01:00:34,760 --> 01:00:37,760
pullback into

1093
01:00:37,760 --> 01:00:40,240
continuation based on whatever side it

1094
01:00:40,240 --> 01:00:42,520
is that we're on

1095
01:00:42,520 --> 01:00:46,520
right so this would end up being this

1096
01:00:46,520 --> 01:00:48,960
drop into

1097
01:00:48,960 --> 01:00:52,119
here would end up being the first swing

1098
01:00:52,119 --> 01:00:53,440
heading

1099
01:00:53,440 --> 01:00:57,920
up so why would we be shorting

1100
01:00:58,240 --> 01:01:00,960
after only

1101
01:01:06,039 --> 01:01:09,480
one wouldn't we be looking for a

1102
01:01:09,480 --> 01:01:11,119
pullback into a

1103
01:01:11,119 --> 01:01:14,680
move back in

1104
01:01:18,559 --> 01:01:22,760
again and that's when you begin to

1105
01:01:23,920 --> 01:01:26,799
question why

1106
01:01:26,799 --> 01:01:30,119
are we so zoomed into price that any

1107
01:01:30,119 --> 01:01:33,640
little candle that forms any any down

1108
01:01:33,640 --> 01:01:35,920
candle any up candle that forms we

1109
01:01:35,920 --> 01:01:39,880
instantly change our

1110
01:01:39,880 --> 01:01:45,680
idea of what we're expecting price to

1111
01:01:45,720 --> 01:01:49,559
do what did the plan

1112
01:01:49,559 --> 01:01:54,400
say what did the plan say

1113
01:02:05,440 --> 01:02:07,400
and the same plan that's on this side

1114
01:02:07,400 --> 01:02:09,400
right is the same plan on this side is

1115
01:02:09,400 --> 01:02:11,599
it

1116
01:02:14,760 --> 01:02:17,480
not so we talked about here the first

1117
01:02:17,480 --> 01:02:19,000
imbalance potentially putting in a new

1118
01:02:19,000 --> 01:02:20,760
high but if we get stuck in this fror if

1119
01:02:20,760 --> 01:02:22,279
we get stuck in that Wick it'll take out

1120
01:02:22,279 --> 01:02:24,240
this low right so here's the first

1121
01:02:24,240 --> 01:02:27,839
imbalance again did it put in a new high

1122
01:02:33,039 --> 01:02:35,240
and anybody running short because they

1123
01:02:35,240 --> 01:02:38,200
see a down candle form and they want to

1124
01:02:38,200 --> 01:02:43,480
short a pullback why are you on that

1125
01:02:45,640 --> 01:02:48,440
side I saw Justin wh say something

1126
01:02:48,440 --> 01:02:50,720
earlier today he said that it's the

1127
01:02:50,720 --> 01:02:52,359
little losses and I was telling my group

1128
01:02:52,359 --> 01:02:54,160
this yesterday so it was funny seeing

1129
01:02:54,160 --> 01:02:56,319
that he says the little losses this

1130
01:02:56,319 --> 01:02:58,039
chipping away

1131
01:02:58,039 --> 01:03:01,799
from the amount you have to

1132
01:03:01,799 --> 01:03:05,880
risk there those little tiny unnecessary

1133
01:03:05,880 --> 01:03:10,039
losses that's chipping away from

1134
01:03:11,240 --> 01:03:16,880
that and yes that's 100% the issue for

1135
01:03:16,880 --> 01:03:20,400
people those little

1136
01:03:22,039 --> 01:03:24,520
losses you're not a bad Trader you need

1137
01:03:24,520 --> 01:03:27,760
better discipline

1138
01:03:28,799 --> 01:03:31,520
you know bad

1139
01:03:32,000 --> 01:03:34,839
trading you need to be better at

1140
01:03:34,839 --> 01:03:38,319
discipline discipline with what your

1141
01:03:38,319 --> 01:03:41,480
plan what is your plan according to what

1142
01:03:41,480 --> 01:03:44,000
you've learned in back testing according

1143
01:03:44,000 --> 01:03:48,960
to it it goes against the tested data

1144
01:03:51,880 --> 01:03:54,160
no I asked some people in the group this

1145
01:03:54,160 --> 01:03:55,559
week we'll work on it next week but I

1146
01:03:55,559 --> 01:03:56,960
ask some people in the group this week I

1147
01:03:56,960 --> 01:04:00,599
said what is your plan to get

1148
01:04:00,599 --> 01:04:04,160
in what's your trade plan the the very

1149
01:04:04,160 --> 01:04:06,839
fourth one the fourth part of your plan

1150
01:04:06,839 --> 01:04:08,440
should be

1151
01:04:08,440 --> 01:04:12,559
execution and people are telling me my

1152
01:04:12,559 --> 01:04:14,920
Concepts also so when we're in a Range

1153
01:04:14,920 --> 01:04:17,240
then I got to make sure that you know at

1154
01:04:17,240 --> 01:04:19,359
the top of the range that's the only

1155
01:04:19,359 --> 01:04:20,799
place that I'm looking for Longs and I'm

1156
01:04:20,799 --> 01:04:22,400
not going to hold everything anything in

1157
01:04:22,400 --> 01:04:24,279
the middle of the range and then how is

1158
01:04:24,279 --> 01:04:26,680
that a plan to get in

1159
01:04:26,680 --> 01:04:29,640
how's that BL to find an

1160
01:04:29,760 --> 01:04:32,559
entury I told people they need structure

1161
01:04:32,559 --> 01:04:34,799
they need narrative then they need their

1162
01:04:34,799 --> 01:04:37,160
zones and then they need their their

1163
01:04:37,160 --> 01:04:38,640
entry

1164
01:04:38,640 --> 01:04:41,200
right I ask somebody what their plan is

1165
01:04:41,200 --> 01:04:46,400
they say structure narrative zones and

1166
01:04:49,960 --> 01:04:54,319
what so there's there's nothing that

1167
01:04:54,319 --> 01:05:00,520
that you can literally spell out to a

1168
01:05:00,520 --> 01:05:04,000
12-year-old for them to look at it and

1169
01:05:04,000 --> 01:05:07,279
then take an entry somewhere around the

1170
01:05:07,279 --> 01:05:09,000
completion of that

1171
01:05:09,000 --> 01:05:14,039
plan all the boxes being checked in that

1172
01:05:14,359 --> 01:05:18,240
plan you don't have a

1173
01:05:21,880 --> 01:05:24,400
plan you cannot get into an entry

1174
01:05:24,400 --> 01:05:26,640
without a plan you cannot get into an

1175
01:05:26,640 --> 01:05:29,279
entry without a plan you cannot get into

1176
01:05:29,279 --> 01:05:31,880
an entry without a plan you cannot get

1177
01:05:31,880 --> 01:05:34,440
into an entry without a plan you cannot

1178
01:05:34,440 --> 01:05:36,839
get into an entry without a plan a plan

1179
01:05:36,839 --> 01:05:39,319
is a plan is not I think it's going to

1180
01:05:39,319 --> 01:05:41,319
reject

1181
01:05:41,319 --> 01:05:43,119
here you know what's going to be

1182
01:05:43,119 --> 01:05:45,960
rejected you're pay

1183
01:05:46,920 --> 01:05:50,640
out that's what's going to be

1184
01:05:52,960 --> 01:05:55,319
rejected I think it's gonna go down from

1185
01:05:55,319 --> 01:05:57,359
here because we still have more you

1186
01:05:57,359 --> 01:05:58,400
think

1187
01:05:58,400 --> 01:06:01,640
what Market looks at you

1188
01:06:01,640 --> 01:06:04,160
like you think you Professor X you you

1189
01:06:04,160 --> 01:06:07,160
can move things with your

1190
01:06:18,839 --> 01:06:21,839
mind

1191
01:06:23,880 --> 01:06:27,880
so it's important to understand that I'm

1192
01:06:27,880 --> 01:06:29,400
sure by the time I got down here

1193
01:06:29,400 --> 01:06:31,799
everybody's like why is he looking to to

1194
01:06:31,799 --> 01:06:33,160
why is he looking to the long side why

1195
01:06:33,160 --> 01:06:35,559
is he looking to go long

1196
01:06:35,559 --> 01:06:39,359
now and what did I say I said before we

1197
01:06:39,359 --> 01:06:41,640
even got

1198
01:06:41,640 --> 01:06:43,880
there I said there are people who are

1199
01:06:43,880 --> 01:06:46,920
ready to go short and they get pulled

1200
01:06:46,920 --> 01:06:51,279
back by 80 something points the other

1201
01:06:51,279 --> 01:06:53,640
way because they're ready to go short so

1202
01:06:53,640 --> 01:06:56,880
I said what I'm looking for is for a

1203
01:06:56,880 --> 01:07:01,880
third higher time frame pullback because

1204
01:07:01,880 --> 01:07:05,920
of these lows that are here right

1205
01:07:05,920 --> 01:07:10,039
looking for that right closure there so

1206
01:07:10,039 --> 01:07:13,520
we get down here it doesn't matter when

1207
01:07:13,520 --> 01:07:16,760
I I you know begin to see what I'm

1208
01:07:16,760 --> 01:07:19,160
looking for either way I know I'm only

1209
01:07:19,160 --> 01:07:22,079
looking for one thing this the move back

1210
01:07:22,079 --> 01:07:23,920
into there because the minute I try to

1211
01:07:23,920 --> 01:07:25,839
go short from something inside of here

1212
01:07:25,839 --> 01:07:28,559
to go down guess what I'm being drawn up

1213
01:07:28,559 --> 01:07:31,880
in that higher time frame

1214
01:07:32,799 --> 01:07:34,839
pullback and where did that higher time

1215
01:07:34,839 --> 01:07:36,720
frame buback go 80 something points the

1216
01:07:36,720 --> 01:07:38,960
other

1217
01:07:44,799 --> 01:07:49,640
way knowing when to when not

1218
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:54,359
to not saying that people can't find

1219
01:07:54,359 --> 01:07:56,640
shorts to continue you

1220
01:07:56,640 --> 01:08:01,200
down should that be what price gives

1221
01:08:05,079 --> 01:08:07,039
you I don't know if you talked about

1222
01:08:07,039 --> 01:08:09,119
this trade I took a short at 10:31

1223
01:08:09,119 --> 01:08:11,520
because I focused on structuring had a

1224
01:08:11,520 --> 01:08:14,880
one minute Zone 5c flip um because the

1225
01:08:14,880 --> 01:08:18,319
higher the Zone got taken out that's

1226
01:08:19,080 --> 01:08:21,679
fine you can short or long wherever you

1227
01:08:21,679 --> 01:08:24,040
want you just have to know how long you

1228
01:08:24,040 --> 01:08:27,440
can hold on to that entry

1229
01:08:28,920 --> 01:08:31,238
that's a

1230
01:08:31,238 --> 01:08:33,880
okay you took a short that's fine other

1231
01:08:33,880 --> 01:08:36,319
people took

1232
01:08:39,560 --> 01:08:42,198
along but you have to know how long you

1233
01:08:42,198 --> 01:08:44,399
can hold

1234
01:08:44,399 --> 01:08:48,158
that and 1 minute 5 second I hope that

1235
01:08:48,158 --> 01:08:50,238
you're profitable because if you're not

1236
01:08:50,238 --> 01:08:51,679
profitable you should not be on the

1237
01:08:51,679 --> 01:08:55,480
5-second time frame

1238
01:08:56,839 --> 01:08:58,520
you guys don't have videos of me

1239
01:08:58,520 --> 01:09:01,279
teaching you the

1240
01:09:01,719 --> 01:09:04,839
5sec none of the accounts that I've I've

1241
01:09:04,839 --> 01:09:07,319
I've been running up at all none of the

1242
01:09:07,319 --> 01:09:08,439
accounts I've been trading would I've

1243
01:09:08,439 --> 01:09:11,399
been trading the 5-second time frame so

1244
01:09:11,399 --> 01:09:12,960
for people to not be successful with the

1245
01:09:12,960 --> 01:09:14,679
one minute and have this lust for

1246
01:09:14,679 --> 01:09:18,239
wanting to be on the 5sec

1247
01:09:21,319 --> 01:09:24,120
no become good with the one minute first

1248
01:09:24,120 --> 01:09:26,120
and then move down to the lower time

1249
01:09:26,120 --> 01:09:29,839
frame anything else is

1250
01:09:32,000 --> 01:09:34,158
backwards so you see what we mentioned

1251
01:09:34,158 --> 01:09:35,719
here looking for the

1252
01:09:35,719 --> 01:09:39,799
pullback down into here

1253
01:09:39,799 --> 01:09:42,839
right for what the possibility

1254
01:09:42,839 --> 01:09:44,600
of

1255
01:09:44,600 --> 01:09:49,319
a move back up into there maybe what is

1256
01:09:49,319 --> 01:09:53,479
this they get this fractal yet no not

1257
01:09:53,479 --> 01:09:55,520
yet I'm thinking just a little a little

1258
01:09:55,520 --> 01:09:58,159
bit lower and then little push off of it

1259
01:09:58,159 --> 01:10:00,960
somewhere down

1260
01:10:04,480 --> 01:10:06,760
here but you have to know what you're

1261
01:10:06,760 --> 01:10:09,120
looking

1262
01:10:17,520 --> 01:10:20,520
for

1263
01:10:22,320 --> 01:10:26,719
so no the uh Q on Keys No I did not

1264
01:10:26,719 --> 01:10:29,000
trade with the Apex payout I did not

1265
01:10:29,000 --> 01:10:31,199
trade the 5-second time frame at all I

1266
01:10:31,199 --> 01:10:35,440
did not trade the second time frame at

1267
01:10:36,040 --> 01:10:39,360
all I was not on the seconds time frame

1268
01:10:39,360 --> 01:10:42,120
at

1269
01:10:45,199 --> 01:10:48,320
all you do not need the seconds time

1270
01:10:48,320 --> 01:10:50,320
frame you need to know where you're

1271
01:10:50,320 --> 01:10:52,120
trading from and you need to trust what

1272
01:10:52,120 --> 01:10:56,000
you're executing on

1273
01:10:56,960 --> 01:10:59,239
that's

1274
01:11:00,480 --> 01:11:03,000
it there's nothing else to it and and

1275
01:11:03,000 --> 01:11:07,000
the average trade on that was like 10

1276
01:11:07,719 --> 01:11:12,120
points this whole this whole move up

1277
01:11:12,120 --> 01:11:15,199
here this whole move up here was 80

1278
01:11:15,199 --> 01:11:17,600
something

1279
01:11:17,760 --> 01:11:20,600
points now couldn't I find an entry to

1280
01:11:20,600 --> 01:11:24,040
give me half of that each trade I took

1281
01:11:24,040 --> 01:11:28,679
yes yes yes that's possible

1282
01:11:28,719 --> 01:11:31,440
yes but what's the sense of

1283
01:11:31,440 --> 01:11:34,640
managing a trade to go remember I said

1284
01:11:34,640 --> 01:11:36,880
that that I I had a belief that it was

1285
01:11:36,880 --> 01:11:39,440
going up above this high

1286
01:11:39,440 --> 01:11:42,440
right which that belief is not not is

1287
01:11:42,440 --> 01:11:46,880
still still have that belief but imagine

1288
01:11:46,880 --> 01:11:50,239
being in an entry somewhere around

1289
01:11:50,239 --> 01:11:54,239
here and

1290
01:11:55,920 --> 01:11:58,159
I believe that we're going to this High

1291
01:11:58,159 --> 01:12:00,960
here

1292
01:12:01,440 --> 01:12:04,199
right and I'm let let's say I'm here in

1293
01:12:04,199 --> 01:12:06,120
the

1294
01:12:06,120 --> 01:12:10,880
entry and now I'm in draw down I'm in

1295
01:12:10,880 --> 01:12:14,000
profit now I'm back into draw down then

1296
01:12:14,000 --> 01:12:16,320
I'm back into profit and then I'm back

1297
01:12:16,320 --> 01:12:18,960
into draw down and then I'm back into

1298
01:12:18,960 --> 01:12:22,840
all of this time that's gone by just to

1299
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:26,199
get a TP here

1300
01:12:26,199 --> 01:12:29,679
it would be crazy of

1301
01:12:32,719 --> 01:12:35,719
me

1302
01:12:36,120 --> 01:12:38,560
when it came this

1303
01:12:38,560 --> 01:12:40,840
close but because I needed to be right

1304
01:12:40,840 --> 01:12:44,199
about seven more points is back to entry

1305
01:12:44,199 --> 01:12:45,800
for me

1306
01:12:45,800 --> 01:12:48,639
again and how many other entries could I

1307
01:12:48,639 --> 01:12:51,719
have found inside of

1308
01:12:51,880 --> 01:12:54,199
here how many other moves could I have

1309
01:12:54,199 --> 01:12:56,800
taken

1310
01:12:56,800 --> 01:12:59,199
in there and and been right

1311
01:12:59,199 --> 01:13:01,440
about and paid

1312
01:13:01,440 --> 01:13:04,960
myself that same

1313
01:13:06,880 --> 01:13:09,320
amount just from knowing where to begin

1314
01:13:09,320 --> 01:13:11,480
scalping where to begin whether it's

1315
01:13:11,480 --> 01:13:13,040
with the trend counter Trend doesn't

1316
01:13:13,040 --> 01:13:15,520
matter which

1317
01:13:16,480 --> 01:13:20,080
one I just know what what is occurring

1318
01:13:20,080 --> 01:13:24,639
here easy to spot

1319
01:13:26,239 --> 01:13:27,360
top of the

1320
01:13:27,360 --> 01:13:31,800
range bottom of the range is

1321
01:13:38,080 --> 01:13:41,280
accumulation knowing where to get in

1322
01:13:41,280 --> 01:13:46,520
knowing when to knowing when not

1323
01:13:48,400 --> 01:13:51,199
to I always get lost in overanalyzing

1324
01:13:51,199 --> 01:13:55,239
that's because you too zoomed in

1325
01:13:57,480 --> 01:14:00,719
there's the problem you two zoomed

1326
01:14:03,239 --> 01:14:05,480
in is the stream going to stay public

1327
01:14:05,480 --> 01:14:08,320
afterwards yes it

1328
01:14:13,199 --> 01:14:16,560
is yeah you you two zoomed

1329
01:14:16,560 --> 01:14:20,639
in 100% that's your

1330
01:14:22,639 --> 01:14:26,560
issue do zoom in

1331
01:14:26,560 --> 01:14:30,639
likewise that's a lot of people's

1332
01:14:30,639 --> 01:14:33,560
issue you think

1333
01:14:33,560 --> 01:14:36,400
that you need to

1334
01:14:36,400 --> 01:14:38,440
be

1335
01:14:38,440 --> 01:14:42,320
facing the candles like this and you'd

1336
01:14:42,320 --> 01:14:44,040
be interpreting every little thing

1337
01:14:44,040 --> 01:14:46,440
inside of

1338
01:14:46,440 --> 01:14:50,440
here when there are things

1339
01:14:50,440 --> 01:14:55,080
that have already occurred

1340
01:14:57,159 --> 01:15:00,719
right there are things that already

1341
01:15:00,719 --> 01:15:03,960
occurred that'll give us the

1342
01:15:03,960 --> 01:15:05,800
understanding of of what's potentially

1343
01:15:05,800 --> 01:15:08,280
getting ready to occur next and we would

1344
01:15:08,280 --> 01:15:10,000
just wait on

1345
01:15:10,000 --> 01:15:12,920
that wait on that right so what's a

1346
01:15:12,920 --> 01:15:15,920
simple example of

1347
01:15:15,920 --> 01:15:19,280
that this high right here whatever this

1348
01:15:19,280 --> 01:15:22,120
is taing into below more than likely it

1349
01:15:22,120 --> 01:15:25,280
often looks to go back and take out that

1350
01:15:25,280 --> 01:15:27,600
previous high right

1351
01:15:27,600 --> 01:15:30,080
there and that'll run right back to this

1352
01:15:30,080 --> 01:15:31,920
fractal with the possibility of taking

1353
01:15:31,920 --> 01:15:36,080
out the high of the fractal because

1354
01:15:38,880 --> 01:15:42,000
of this Zone above here not entirely

1355
01:15:42,000 --> 01:15:44,280
being

1356
01:15:44,600 --> 01:15:48,600
mitigated so we we have that we we have

1357
01:15:48,600 --> 01:15:50,920
that that little

1358
01:15:50,920 --> 01:15:54,320
understanding of that and if if that's

1359
01:15:54,320 --> 01:15:56,840
what we believe is going to occur if

1360
01:15:56,840 --> 01:15:58,480
we're on the lower second if we're on

1361
01:15:58,480 --> 01:15:59,880
the the the lower time frame we're on

1362
01:15:59,880 --> 01:16:04,880
the second time frame and we see our uh

1363
01:16:04,880 --> 01:16:08,800
uh seconds uh confirmation within here

1364
01:16:08,800 --> 01:16:10,320
then we trade

1365
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:15,239
that if we're willing to take whatever

1366
01:16:15,239 --> 01:16:17,760
is here to the left and utilize trading

1367
01:16:17,760 --> 01:16:20,199
off of that then we trade

1368
01:16:20,199 --> 01:16:24,000
that but regardless of what it is we

1369
01:16:24,000 --> 01:16:26,440
have to be willing to accept what the

1370
01:16:26,440 --> 01:16:28,440
loss behind that that area we're

1371
01:16:28,440 --> 01:16:31,719
choosing to trade from except that this

1372
01:16:31,719 --> 01:16:37,159
is our uh um um take profit or or this

1373
01:16:37,159 --> 01:16:40,080
is what we're looking for to looking to

1374
01:16:40,080 --> 01:16:44,480
occur and when this happens we need to

1375
01:16:44,480 --> 01:16:46,560
know where we are exiting not trying to

1376
01:16:46,560 --> 01:16:48,440
a lot of people ask me this question how

1377
01:16:48,440 --> 01:16:49,880
do you

1378
01:16:49,880 --> 01:16:52,760
manage um how do you manage your stop

1379
01:16:52,760 --> 01:16:55,760
losses

1380
01:16:55,760 --> 01:16:58,239
like how do you

1381
01:16:58,239 --> 01:17:02,239
Trail your stop losses I Trail my stop-

1382
01:17:02,239 --> 01:17:05,159
losses by taking

1383
01:17:05,560 --> 01:17:09,600
profit that's how I try my stop

1384
01:17:10,440 --> 01:17:15,920
losses I try my stop losses by taking

1385
01:17:17,679 --> 01:17:20,000
profit

1386
01:17:20,000 --> 01:17:22,120
so

1387
01:17:22,120 --> 01:17:26,080
again pay yourself

1388
01:17:26,080 --> 01:17:28,679
um guys you recommend college and trade

1389
01:17:28,679 --> 01:17:30,960
or just trade you should do college

1390
01:17:30,960 --> 01:17:33,560
defin if you're in college do college

1391
01:17:33,560 --> 01:17:35,600
definitely

1392
01:17:35,600 --> 01:17:37,920
100% because if trading doesn't work out

1393
01:17:37,920 --> 01:17:41,320
for you you have something to fall back

1394
01:17:42,120 --> 01:17:46,320
on so College

1395
01:17:46,320 --> 01:17:48,560
100% it teaches you how to complete

1396
01:17:48,560 --> 01:17:52,360
something it teaches you how to finish

1397
01:17:53,400 --> 01:17:56,520
something College taught me a lot was it

1398
01:17:56,520 --> 01:17:59,280
needed for me

1399
01:17:59,280 --> 01:18:02,480
no because I don't currently use the

1400
01:18:02,480 --> 01:18:07,320
degree but it taught me how to learn

1401
01:18:07,320 --> 01:18:09,159
properly that's what it did it taught me

1402
01:18:09,159 --> 01:18:11,320
how to learn

1403
01:18:11,320 --> 01:18:15,560
properly so if if

1404
01:18:15,560 --> 01:18:17,800
that's you know something that you still

1405
01:18:17,800 --> 01:18:20,639
struggle with with learning then then

1406
01:18:20,639 --> 01:18:22,120
you know you need to learn and

1407
01:18:22,120 --> 01:18:26,159
successfully complete something

1408
01:18:27,679 --> 01:18:31,360
you learn and successfully complete

1409
01:18:32,320 --> 01:18:34,719
something I left College last year I

1410
01:18:34,719 --> 01:18:38,320
mean hey it's not for everybody you

1411
01:18:38,840 --> 01:18:41,679
know uh this DRS are distracting your

1412
01:18:41,679 --> 01:18:44,199
mouth is distracting uh what was your

1413
01:18:44,199 --> 01:18:47,040
degree in uh

1414
01:18:47,639 --> 01:18:49,719
psychology uh been taking 10 points for

1415
01:18:49,719 --> 01:18:53,239
this Market beautiful

1416
01:18:55,719 --> 01:18:59,000
um that's too far away please zoom in

1417
01:18:59,000 --> 01:19:01,760
put your glasses on when the mentorship

1418
01:19:01,760 --> 01:19:03,639
reopen I'm not too sure

1419
01:19:03,639 --> 01:19:06,520
yet um I Heard somewhere you recommend a

1420
01:19:06,520 --> 01:19:08,159
profitable loser everywhere I recommend

1421
01:19:08,159 --> 01:19:10,719
the profitable

1422
01:19:10,719 --> 01:19:13,719
loser

1423
01:19:16,000 --> 01:19:19,719
uh let me see how do you know it is

1424
01:19:19,719 --> 01:19:22,920
accumulation because I am he the master

1425
01:19:22,920 --> 01:19:26,199
back tester

1426
01:19:28,040 --> 01:19:31,480
um let me

1427
01:19:38,280 --> 01:19:40,960
see how not to get lost I told you that

1428
01:19:40,960 --> 01:19:45,080
zoom out make sure you zoom out

1429
01:19:57,120 --> 01:19:59,880
uh let me

1430
01:19:59,880 --> 01:20:03,280
see how do proper plan looks like um you

1431
01:20:03,280 --> 01:20:06,239
got to find it in back

1432
01:20:07,440 --> 01:20:09,920
testing cover the kids

1433
01:20:09,920 --> 01:20:13,400
is Target

1434
01:20:13,920 --> 01:20:16,320
filled

1435
01:20:16,320 --> 01:20:18,520
um always confused with counter swing

1436
01:20:18,520 --> 01:20:20,120
since as count seven well you got to

1437
01:20:20,120 --> 01:20:21,440
know that they're from different time

1438
01:20:21,440 --> 01:20:23,560
frames so that's your problem you're not

1439
01:20:23,560 --> 01:20:26,199
counting um

1440
01:20:26,199 --> 01:20:29,239
from one specific time

1441
01:20:34,040 --> 01:20:36,920
frame this feels like House of no music

1442
01:20:36,920 --> 01:20:39,360
that is true but you know this is

1443
01:20:39,360 --> 01:20:41,159
something that people need to

1444
01:20:41,159 --> 01:20:44,199
see um that I'm saying this

1445
01:20:44,199 --> 01:20:47,360
beforehand and we're watching it do it

1446
01:20:47,360 --> 01:20:49,400
and then we're seeing the completion of

1447
01:20:49,400 --> 01:20:53,080
it and I'm giving all the wise for it

1448
01:20:53,080 --> 01:20:55,679
and I'm telling people how they

1449
01:20:55,679 --> 01:20:59,719
should look to set their entries up and

1450
01:20:59,719 --> 01:21:01,840
where they should look to take profit

1451
01:21:01,840 --> 01:21:03,199
and you know all of those different

1452
01:21:03,199 --> 01:21:05,239
things I'm I'm teaching it in real time

1453
01:21:05,239 --> 01:21:07,199
it's not just going over something in

1454
01:21:07,199 --> 01:21:09,520
past price action oh I want to see a low

1455
01:21:09,520 --> 01:21:11,760
get taken hey nobody care about that I

1456
01:21:11,760 --> 01:21:12,960
don't have enough money for a high and

1457
01:21:12,960 --> 01:21:15,440
low to be taken I want to show you

1458
01:21:15,440 --> 01:21:16,960
what's happening now and here's why I

1459
01:21:16,960 --> 01:21:18,239
believe it and here's what I think it's

1460
01:21:18,239 --> 01:21:19,679
going to happen and here's because

1461
01:21:19,679 --> 01:21:20,920
because I the thing is going to happen

1462
01:21:20,920 --> 01:21:22,239
not because I'm trading what I think

1463
01:21:22,239 --> 01:21:24,040
it's because I've tested and verified

1464
01:21:24,040 --> 01:21:26,480
this over and over and over and over and

1465
01:21:26,480 --> 01:21:28,440
over and over and over and over and over

1466
01:21:28,440 --> 01:21:30,199
and over and over and over and over and

1467
01:21:30,199 --> 01:21:32,199
over I've watched this more than you've

1468
01:21:32,199 --> 01:21:34,639
watched TV I've watched this more than

1469
01:21:34,639 --> 01:21:37,560
you play video games so I know beyond

1470
01:21:37,560 --> 01:21:39,400
the shadow of a doubt whatever it is

1471
01:21:39,400 --> 01:21:41,520
that I see occurring whatever it is that

1472
01:21:41,520 --> 01:21:43,639
I believe is occurring I know that I'm

1473
01:21:43,639 --> 01:21:45,920
going to trust that over trusting you

1474
01:21:45,920 --> 01:21:48,239
us3 is about to dump and then you watch

1475
01:21:48,239 --> 01:21:51,520
it pump 100 points into your

1476
01:21:51,520 --> 01:21:55,880
nostrils because what

1477
01:21:55,880 --> 01:21:57,840
you thinking that something is going to

1478
01:21:57,840 --> 01:22:01,320
happen versus you verifying in price

1479
01:22:01,320 --> 01:22:05,280
that this is something that occurs

1480
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:25,280
right so

1481
01:22:44,360 --> 01:22:48,960
I I told yall y you gota you gotta

1482
01:22:49,000 --> 01:22:51,800
accept you got to accept the law you got

1483
01:22:51,800 --> 01:22:53,719
to accept what what it is you're you're

1484
01:22:53,719 --> 01:22:56,080
wagering you got to accept the fact that

1485
01:22:56,080 --> 01:22:57,880
this this is your target you got to

1486
01:22:57,880 --> 01:22:59,600
accept the fact that this is how you

1487
01:22:59,600 --> 01:23:02,199
you're anticipating your setup to

1488
01:23:02,199 --> 01:23:04,600
occur if you have not verified these

1489
01:23:04,600 --> 01:23:06,000
things in back testing you can never

1490
01:23:06,000 --> 01:23:08,360
trust them in forward

1491
01:23:08,360 --> 01:23:10,199
testing some of y'all just want a

1492
01:23:10,199 --> 01:23:11,920
forward test and not back test okay

1493
01:23:11,920 --> 01:23:13,800
that's

1494
01:23:13,800 --> 01:23:16,199
fine somebody told me I was a white

1495
01:23:16,199 --> 01:23:17,920
supremacist because I told them they

1496
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:19,480
need to back test the question they

1497
01:23:19,480 --> 01:23:20,360
asked

1498
01:23:20,360 --> 01:23:25,199
me now back testing is a racial slur

1499
01:23:25,199 --> 01:23:27,320
crazy

1500
01:23:27,320 --> 01:23:29,000
right

1501
01:23:29,000 --> 01:23:33,320
so you know you you need to back test

1502
01:23:33,320 --> 01:23:35,120
more than you forward test back testing

1503
01:23:35,120 --> 01:23:38,239
is more important than forward

1504
01:23:38,239 --> 01:23:42,199
testing back testing is more important

1505
01:23:42,199 --> 01:23:43,760
than forward testing you're not going to

1506
01:23:43,760 --> 01:23:45,600
hear a lot of people tell you

1507
01:23:45,600 --> 01:23:47,560
that but you're also not going to hear a

1508
01:23:47,560 --> 01:23:50,400
lot of people say the things I say every

1509
01:23:50,400 --> 01:23:53,120
day is a trading day every day is a

1510
01:23:53,120 --> 01:23:55,400
profitable day it's a blessing be on the

1511
01:23:55,400 --> 01:23:56,560
right side of the market you're not

1512
01:23:56,560 --> 01:23:59,760
going to hear people talking like

1513
01:24:00,760 --> 01:24:03,199
that you're not going to hear people you

1514
01:24:03,199 --> 01:24:05,679
know something happened overnight

1515
01:24:05,679 --> 01:24:08,280
everybody's like oh trade demo today

1516
01:24:08,280 --> 01:24:10,080
because the price action is going to be

1517
01:24:10,080 --> 01:24:12,800
don't you dare because we we it's so

1518
01:24:12,800 --> 01:24:15,560
much uncertainty Israel Obama Iran and

1519
01:24:15,560 --> 01:24:18,520
y'all so addicted to trading it's Friday

1520
01:24:18,520 --> 01:24:21,080
you should go and and and you should you

1521
01:24:21,080 --> 01:24:22,960
should be studying you should not want

1522
01:24:22,960 --> 01:24:24,760
to have to just push the button all the

1523
01:24:24,760 --> 01:24:26,760
time that's an addiction you and they

1524
01:24:26,760 --> 01:24:29,880
projecting all of that on

1525
01:24:30,239 --> 01:24:32,679
you when it's the same stuff occurring

1526
01:24:32,679 --> 01:24:34,239
each and every day how dare you say it's

1527
01:24:34,239 --> 01:24:36,960
an algorithm and you act like it's it's

1528
01:24:36,960 --> 01:24:39,840
going to do something

1529
01:24:39,920 --> 01:24:42,119
different scriptures do one thing and

1530
01:24:42,119 --> 01:24:43,639
only one

1531
01:24:43,639 --> 01:24:46,320
thing and when you see that thing you

1532
01:24:46,320 --> 01:24:50,159
know you saw him back testing time and

1533
01:24:50,159 --> 01:24:55,000
time and time again

1534
01:24:55,800 --> 01:24:59,600
that's where your profitability

1535
01:24:59,600 --> 01:25:02,600
is

1536
01:25:05,159 --> 01:25:09,520
right that's where your profitability

1537
01:25:20,080 --> 01:25:21,880
is what do you think of today's

1538
01:25:21,880 --> 01:25:25,560
quarterly Theory um

1539
01:25:25,560 --> 01:25:28,000
I wish him a quadrennial year I don't

1540
01:25:28,000 --> 01:25:29,639
know anything about

1541
01:25:29,639 --> 01:25:31,920
that instead of saying Happy New Year to

1542
01:25:31,920 --> 01:25:34,320
people now I'm say happy quadral

1543
01:25:34,320 --> 01:25:37,280
year hopefully I'm right I don't know

1544
01:25:37,280 --> 01:25:39,840
anything about

1545
01:25:41,159 --> 01:25:43,520
that when does the one to one fail why

1546
01:25:43,520 --> 01:25:44,719
you don't want to back to us how about

1547
01:25:44,719 --> 01:25:46,239
you go and back to us and see when it

1548
01:25:46,239 --> 01:25:48,159
fails you just going to ask questions

1549
01:25:48,159 --> 01:25:51,679
all the time AP trades what's up baby

1550
01:25:51,679 --> 01:25:55,960

1551
01:25:55,960 --> 01:25:58,360
back

1552
01:25:59,360 --> 01:26:01,960
test oh no that that's that's not the AP

1553
01:26:01,960 --> 01:26:03,760
trades we talking about hold up that's

1554
01:26:03,760 --> 01:26:06,639
that's a fool my

1555
01:26:06,639 --> 01:26:09,560
bad wrong wrong wrong AP trades look at

1556
01:26:09,560 --> 01:26:12,040
this look at

1557
01:26:16,440 --> 01:26:18,800
this oh is that the right AP trades I

1558
01:26:18,800 --> 01:26:20,920
don't I don't know I'm

1559
01:26:20,920 --> 01:26:23,639

should should we block him chat or or

1563
01:26:35,760 --> 01:26:40,480
she that's not AP trades that's PA

trades that's his

1565
01:26:46,840 --> 01:26:48,719
cousin trying to see with the chat

1566
01:26:48,719 --> 01:26:50,080

01:26:57,480 --> 01:27:02,760
ap3 never mind no poll anymore

1571
01:27:02,760 --> 01:27:06,840
so this this is this is what you know I

1572
01:27:06,840 --> 01:27:10,360
I want you guys to to

1573
01:27:10,360 --> 01:27:13,159
consider remember what I

1574
01:27:13,159 --> 01:27:16,600
said I said that when we begin that

1575
01:27:16,600 --> 01:27:18,639
accumulation I started off in this in

1576
01:27:18,639 --> 01:27:19,600
this

1577
01:27:19,600 --> 01:27:23,440
video talking about it you guys go back

1578
01:27:23,440 --> 01:27:25,800
into the video you hear me

1579
01:27:25,800 --> 01:27:29,320
discussing I started off

1580
01:27:29,320 --> 01:27:32,800
saying how to trade accumulation now

1581
01:27:32,800 --> 01:27:36,080
accumulation what we're discussing is

1582
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:37,760
what happens from higher time frame to

1583
01:27:37,760 --> 01:27:39,960
lower time frame

1584
01:27:39,960 --> 01:27:43,040
right that's what we're talking about

1585
01:27:43,040 --> 01:27:46,679
it's not something that's restrictive to

1586
01:27:46,679 --> 01:27:49,000
this one time

1587
01:27:49,000 --> 01:27:51,320
frame accumulation is the same kind of

1588
01:27:51,320 --> 01:27:54,800
accumulation on all time frames not just

1589
01:27:54,800 --> 01:27:56,960
to this one time frame so what we talked

1590
01:27:56,960 --> 01:27:59,080
about here

1591
01:27:59,080 --> 01:28:01,719
is the accumulation above right here

1592
01:28:01,719 --> 01:28:06,000
right so what we should be expecting or

1593
01:28:06,000 --> 01:28:07,560
anticipating

1594
01:28:07,560 --> 01:28:10,760
is when we open up it let's say let's

1595
01:28:10,760 --> 01:28:14,400
say we leave this Wick here when we open

1596
01:28:14,400 --> 01:28:17,800
up we should be looking for price to

1597
01:28:17,800 --> 01:28:20,360
trade at least back to this fractal

1598
01:28:20,360 --> 01:28:22,880
right or slightly up above it and then

1599
01:28:22,880 --> 01:28:24,920
shift back into the range

1600
01:28:24,920 --> 01:28:26,840
for

1601
01:28:26,840 --> 01:28:29,400
Monday if it closes like

1602
01:28:29,400 --> 01:28:33,000
this we should be anticipating that

1603
01:28:33,000 --> 01:28:35,719
based on the area that we're tapping

1604
01:28:35,719 --> 01:28:39,320
into to the left

1605
01:28:40,560 --> 01:28:43,520
right and we know that we just took a a

1606
01:28:43,520 --> 01:28:44,960
low

1607
01:28:44,960 --> 01:28:48,080
right and we know all Concepts work

1608
01:28:48,080 --> 01:28:51,239
right so here we have the support and

1609
01:28:51,239 --> 01:28:55,480
resistance this is prior support turn

1610
01:28:55,480 --> 01:28:56,880
resistance so we would be looking for

1611
01:28:56,880 --> 01:29:00,040
the retest of this previous support turn

1612
01:29:00,040 --> 01:29:03,000
resistance right so that's one thing

1613
01:29:03,000 --> 01:29:06,960
two we should be looking at Price taking

1614
01:29:06,960 --> 01:29:09,880
a low and rebalancing to an fvg right

1615
01:29:09,880 --> 01:29:12,440
this ICT concept whatever we should be

1616
01:29:12,440 --> 01:29:16,719
looking at dtfa of course you know with

1617
01:29:16,719 --> 01:29:18,600
the the zones that we in we anticipating

1618
01:29:18,600 --> 01:29:21,960
price to trade you know out of this snd

1619
01:29:21,960 --> 01:29:23,600
response but at least above the previous

1620
01:29:23,600 --> 01:29:24,600
candles

1621
01:29:24,600 --> 01:29:26,679
this is a daily time frame that we're

1622
01:29:26,679 --> 01:29:28,920
we're now you know forecasting some of

1623
01:29:28,920 --> 01:29:30,280
this

1624
01:29:30,280 --> 01:29:33,119
stuff we know that this is a four candle

1625
01:29:33,119 --> 01:29:35,920
drop based on a daily right so if this

1626
01:29:35,920 --> 01:29:38,119
is a four candle drop based on a

1627
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:40,880
daily then what we're looking for is the

1628
01:29:40,880 --> 01:29:44,280
people that go long from here we know

1629
01:29:44,280 --> 01:29:45,760
there's a possibility that price takes

1630
01:29:45,760 --> 01:29:48,639
them out first and then trades in the

1631
01:29:48,639 --> 01:29:50,320
other way to take the high out that was

1632
01:29:50,320 --> 01:29:51,920
put in so whether that high goes above

1633
01:29:51,920 --> 01:29:53,280
the previous candle High whether it runs

1634
01:29:53,280 --> 01:29:55,360
into the fractor just just up above what

1635
01:29:55,360 --> 01:29:59,360
we're anticipating for the day right or

1636
01:29:59,360 --> 01:30:00,960
or maybe not even the day let's say the

1637
01:30:00,960 --> 01:30:03,239
day Clos as a doy the following day can

1638
01:30:03,239 --> 01:30:05,800
run to that

1639
01:30:06,400 --> 01:30:08,920
high and then you got people going oh

1640
01:30:08,920 --> 01:30:11,880
the high of the week putting on Tuesday

1641
01:30:11,880 --> 01:30:13,280
and then the L you know all of those

1642
01:30:13,280 --> 01:30:15,000
different things that are in

1643
01:30:15,000 --> 01:30:17,840
there which which they all you know sort

1644
01:30:17,840 --> 01:30:18,800
of work

1645
01:30:18,800 --> 01:30:22,800
out uh uh the same

1646
01:30:22,800 --> 01:30:25,880
way but

1647
01:30:25,880 --> 01:30:28,639
but we would essentially be considering

1648
01:30:28,639 --> 01:30:31,159
that because what we also know that we

1649
01:30:31,159 --> 01:30:32,800
at the bottom of a

1650
01:30:32,800 --> 01:30:35,040
range we know Long's in the bottom of

1651
01:30:35,040 --> 01:30:37,520
the range

1652
01:30:40,159 --> 01:30:42,800
right so it means Monday into Tuesday

1653
01:30:42,800 --> 01:30:45,040
you could have that

1654
01:30:45,040 --> 01:30:47,719
run going back into the range going back

1655
01:30:47,719 --> 01:30:50,320
to retest to whatever it is going back

1656
01:30:50,320 --> 01:30:53,080
to rebalance going whatever it is it's

1657
01:30:53,080 --> 01:30:55,920
doing

1658
01:30:56,800 --> 01:30:58,639
you go to the weekly time frame you know

1659
01:30:58,639 --> 01:31:00,920
the weekly time frame the weekly candle

1660
01:31:00,920 --> 01:31:04,679
could open put in a wick here and then

1661
01:31:04,679 --> 01:31:10,600
what the that's for the the uh the P3

1662
01:31:10,600 --> 01:31:15,440
Bros then what put in a body like

1663
01:31:15,679 --> 01:31:19,320
that and then have a

1664
01:31:19,639 --> 01:31:24,560
wick just below it like that

1665
01:31:26,320 --> 01:31:28,840
next candle TS back into the wick follow

1666
01:31:28,840 --> 01:31:30,920
candle moves up like that above the

1667
01:31:30,920 --> 01:31:34,040
previous week's high

1668
01:31:34,040 --> 01:31:37,600
now tons of stuff you could anticipate

1669
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,119
you can you can think

1670
01:31:40,119 --> 01:31:42,840
of you see

1671
01:31:42,840 --> 01:31:45,000
happening but some people just have no

1672
01:31:45,000 --> 01:31:48,400
real material materialization of of

1673
01:31:48,400 --> 01:31:52,440
getting into the trade getting into the

1674
01:31:52,560 --> 01:31:54,760
move so

1675
01:31:54,760 --> 01:31:58,960
remember what I said I said that we

1676
01:31:58,960 --> 01:32:03,000
often get the sweep of that low right

1677
01:32:03,000 --> 01:32:05,119
and when we get the sweep of that low

1678
01:32:05,119 --> 01:32:07,800
what you tend to see is

1679
01:32:07,800 --> 01:32:10,600
that when price leaves a little Wick

1680
01:32:10,600 --> 01:32:13,360
behind

1681
01:32:13,360 --> 01:32:16,880
here often times what we're anticipating

1682
01:32:16,880 --> 01:32:18,600
is for price to run back to it and

1683
01:32:18,600 --> 01:32:23,119
potentially take the high of it right so

1684
01:32:23,119 --> 01:32:26,520
there's a a a ton of

1685
01:32:26,520 --> 01:32:28,360
reasons

1686
01:32:28,360 --> 01:32:30,880
why you know we can be getting into

1687
01:32:30,880 --> 01:32:33,920
little entries to

1688
01:32:33,920 --> 01:32:38,000
scalp and little areas that we we you

1689
01:32:38,000 --> 01:32:39,880
know are Nimble on in terms of taking

1690
01:32:39,880 --> 01:32:41,520
profit

1691
01:32:41,520 --> 01:32:44,760
and it's just that it has to be a part

1692
01:32:44,760 --> 01:32:45,840
of our

1693
01:32:45,840 --> 01:32:51,880
plan it must be a part of our plan must

1694
01:32:51,880 --> 01:32:56,520
number one it must be a part of our

1695
01:32:57,800 --> 01:33:00,560
plan

1696
01:33:00,560 --> 01:33:03,960
so there goes my low

1697
01:33:03,960 --> 01:33:07,679
there previous candle's high is

1698
01:33:07,679 --> 01:33:10,400
here you the bullish close above could

1699
01:33:10,400 --> 01:33:14,239
run right into that Wick right there

1700
01:33:14,239 --> 01:33:16,480
right and with that you have to know

1701
01:33:16,480 --> 01:33:19,400
beyond a shadow of a doubt that you've

1702
01:33:19,400 --> 01:33:20,600
seen

1703
01:33:20,600 --> 01:33:24,600
it in order to take part in it

1704
01:33:24,600 --> 01:33:29,280
in order to trade it like you know you

1705
01:33:29,280 --> 01:33:30,880
you

1706
01:33:30,880 --> 01:33:34,159
know that St price hit there there a

1707
01:33:34,159 --> 01:33:36,840
possibility of giving you a heat heat a

1708
01:33:36,840 --> 01:33:39,520
TP look at that that's a dyslexia

1709
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,480
possibility of giving you TP

1710
01:33:41,480 --> 01:33:45,800
there at at this this high but most

1711
01:33:45,800 --> 01:33:47,000
importantly it could just be looking to

1712
01:33:47,000 --> 01:33:49,480
run back

1713
01:33:49,480 --> 01:33:54,080
into that zone there

1714
01:33:55,800 --> 01:33:57,719
right there so we got a

1715
01:33:57,719 --> 01:34:01,800
sweep on the lower time frame

1716
01:34:01,800 --> 01:34:04,280
here and if we can get up above this and

1717
01:34:04,280 --> 01:34:06,600
close then we can run to that high there

1718
01:34:06,600 --> 01:34:10,360
and it's as simple as

1719
01:34:21,840 --> 01:34:26,199
that so what is it it do if it gets into

1720
01:34:26,199 --> 01:34:27,719
here you know there's a possibility of

1721
01:34:27,719 --> 01:34:29,679
rejecting back

1722
01:34:29,679 --> 01:34:32,560
into whatever Zone it would have created

1723
01:34:32,560 --> 01:34:35,639
below and if that's enough to take price

1724
01:34:35,639 --> 01:34:38,040
higher Above This Wick that's what it

1725
01:34:38,040 --> 01:34:42,000
does if it's not then it struggles in

1726
01:34:42,000 --> 01:34:46,920
there and then puts in another

1727
01:34:47,679 --> 01:34:51,600
low but you have to know how it looks

1728
01:34:51,600 --> 01:34:53,920
from lower time frame to high higher

1729
01:34:53,920 --> 01:34:55,560
time frame so what do we have on a lower

1730
01:34:55,560 --> 01:34:57,119
time frame here what we have is these

1731
01:34:57,119 --> 01:35:00,440
swings right we have

1732
01:35:00,440 --> 01:35:06,320
one we have two we have three we have

1733
01:35:06,320 --> 01:35:09,760
four we have

1734
01:35:10,880 --> 01:35:14,560
five so we have five swings that are

1735
01:35:14,560 --> 01:35:17,360
currently on this lower time frame

1736
01:35:17,360 --> 01:35:20,840
heading down so the same thing that we

1737
01:35:20,840 --> 01:35:23,440
mentioned here moving down into here and

1738
01:35:23,440 --> 01:35:24,920
then you begin to see price move

1739
01:35:24,920 --> 01:35:27,320
sideways here and you begin to see price

1740
01:35:27,320 --> 01:35:30,159
move back up above there the same exact

1741
01:35:30,159 --> 01:35:32,400
thing

1742
01:35:33,880 --> 01:35:37,159
here so here would essentially be

1743
01:35:37,159 --> 01:35:41,119
waiting to capitalize on that moment of

1744
01:35:41,119 --> 01:35:43,480
running back into the previous

1745
01:35:43,480 --> 01:35:46,679
range and there's several techniques

1746
01:35:46,679 --> 01:35:49,719
that I've shared in the dis I mean in

1747
01:35:49,719 --> 01:35:52,719
the Discord on YouTube the several

1748
01:35:52,719 --> 01:35:57,080
techniques that I've shared on how

1749
01:35:57,080 --> 01:36:00,239
to get into an entry specifically video

1750
01:36:00,239 --> 01:36:03,159
7 and video 8 but y'all don't like to

1751
01:36:03,159 --> 01:36:05,840
read y'all don't like to watch y'all

1752
01:36:05,840 --> 01:36:08,360
don't like to write but y'all expect to

1753
01:36:08,360 --> 01:36:10,040
learn it

1754
01:36:10,040 --> 01:36:13,719
just it it is beyond me you don't want

1755
01:36:13,719 --> 01:36:16,400
to read you don't want to write you

1756
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:17,920
don't want to watch but you think you're

1757
01:36:17,920 --> 01:36:19,040
going to

1758
01:36:19,040 --> 01:36:21,320
learn that's why I told a young man to

1759
01:36:21,320 --> 01:36:24,520
ask about college go

1760
01:36:24,520 --> 01:36:26,000
to

1761
01:36:26,000 --> 01:36:29,560
college it will teach you how to

1762
01:36:29,560 --> 01:36:32,800
learn go to

1763
01:36:32,800 --> 01:36:35,400
college so there's

1764
01:36:35,400 --> 01:36:39,280
the six swing

1765
01:36:42,840 --> 01:36:44,920
there and you see

1766
01:36:44,920 --> 01:36:49,480
it wicking up

1767
01:36:56,400 --> 01:36:59,159
six swing there you could look for it to

1768
01:36:59,159 --> 01:37:02,800
move back above these highs and I

1769
01:37:04,080 --> 01:37:06,440
still have us looking to get back into

1770
01:37:06,440 --> 01:37:10,119
this wake

1771
01:37:12,119 --> 01:37:14,239
here

1772
01:37:14,239 --> 01:37:17,600
so you have to learn how to

1773
01:37:17,600 --> 01:37:20,520
learn you cannot think that you could

1774
01:37:20,520 --> 01:37:24,280
sit there and watch a 27 minute video

1775
01:37:24,280 --> 01:37:26,560
and all of a sudden you're

1776
01:37:26,560 --> 01:37:28,440
profitable because you still got to

1777
01:37:28,440 --> 01:37:30,199
watch it in real time and guess what

1778
01:37:30,199 --> 01:37:33,159
those videos they're in real

1779
01:37:33,159 --> 01:37:36,480
time they're in real time go and look at

1780
01:37:36,480 --> 01:37:38,320
somebody's back tested video and then go

1781
01:37:38,320 --> 01:37:40,520
and try to replicate it I promise you

1782
01:37:40,520 --> 01:37:43,320
you're still not going to be

1783
01:37:44,520 --> 01:37:49,119
profitable you are still not going to be

1784
01:37:49,119 --> 01:37:51,960
profitable still not going to be

1785
01:37:51,960 --> 01:37:54,920
profitable oh you stole so and so you

1786
01:37:54,920 --> 01:37:56,800
just doing the Quasi Moto so you knew

1787
01:37:56,800 --> 01:37:58,520
about the Quasi Moto all these years and

1788
01:37:58,520 --> 01:38:00,080
you still struggling with profitability

1789
01:38:00,080 --> 01:38:02,000
what's up with

1790
01:38:02,000 --> 01:38:04,840
that I wasn't I wasn't profitable off of

1791
01:38:04,840 --> 01:38:06,599
the Quasi motor I was profitable off of

1792
01:38:06,599 --> 01:38:10,040
trend lines what's up with

1793
01:38:11,440 --> 01:38:15,080
that what's up with that you KN you knew

1794
01:38:15,080 --> 01:38:16,920
all this time about that what's up with

1795
01:38:16,920 --> 01:38:19,920
that

1796
01:38:23,719 --> 01:38:26,440
you know all of these

1797
01:38:26,440 --> 01:38:28,920
strategies you know who stole what but

1798
01:38:28,920 --> 01:38:30,320
you can't use it

1799
01:38:30,320 --> 01:38:32,520
yourself oh that's right you you just

1800
01:38:32,520 --> 01:38:36,639
the the trading encyclopedia

1801
01:38:37,080 --> 01:38:40,199
okay you just your trading

1802
01:38:40,199 --> 01:38:42,239
encyclopedia and everybody else that

1803
01:38:42,239 --> 01:38:44,199
comes around what do they want to

1804
01:38:44,199 --> 01:38:46,920
do they want to reinvent the wheel but

1805
01:38:46,920 --> 01:38:49,719
they don't know how to

1806
01:38:50,199 --> 01:38:54,199
drive going reinvent the wheel

1807
01:38:54,199 --> 01:38:57,119
yet you don't know how to

1808
01:38:58,199 --> 01:39:02,280
drive something is up with

1809
01:39:03,239 --> 01:39:07,239
that reinvent the

1810
01:39:07,280 --> 01:39:10,920
wheel don't know how to

1811
01:39:11,199 --> 01:39:13,159
drive so that's why I don't listen to

1812
01:39:13,159 --> 01:39:14,920
people who who say other things about

1813
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,840
other strategies and oh well this is

1814
01:39:16,840 --> 01:39:18,599
going to do that because if you look at

1815
01:39:18,599 --> 01:39:19,520
this and then pair it with the

1816
01:39:19,520 --> 01:39:21,080
fundamentals with that and then do that

1817
01:39:21,080 --> 01:39:23,480
and then that's not going to change my

1818
01:39:23,480 --> 01:39:25,599
idea of what I believe price is doing

1819
01:39:25,599 --> 01:39:27,679
what I believe price is going to

1820
01:39:27,679 --> 01:39:30,199
do that is not going to change my I

1821
01:39:30,199 --> 01:39:31,719
could tell you that

1822
01:39:31,719 --> 01:39:36,920
much that is not going to change my

1823
01:39:36,920 --> 01:39:41,040
idea of what I believe price is going to

1824
01:39:41,040 --> 01:39:43,280
do because what I've seen in back

1825
01:39:43,280 --> 01:39:45,840
testing is

1826
01:39:48,639 --> 01:39:50,920
enough them trend lines work and people

1827
01:39:50,920 --> 01:39:54,159
still giving Tor shape that's because

1828
01:39:54,159 --> 01:39:55,760
people are ignorant people think that

1829
01:39:55,760 --> 01:39:57,440
just because they have strategies that

1830
01:39:57,440 --> 01:39:59,119
could lower their

1831
01:39:59,119 --> 01:40:02,599
risk to far less of a risk than a trend

1832
01:40:02,599 --> 01:40:06,480
line can or a triangle can or a channel

1833
01:40:06,480 --> 01:40:08,880
can or whatever it is or or the support

1834
01:40:08,880 --> 01:40:10,480
and resistance can they think that

1835
01:40:10,480 --> 01:40:11,719
because they have these strategies that

1836
01:40:11,719 --> 01:40:14,199
could lower their risk a lot more they

1837
01:40:14,199 --> 01:40:16,480
look down on everybody

1838
01:40:16,480 --> 01:40:19,159
else and it's funny

1839
01:40:19,159 --> 01:40:21,840
because now that the ICT Community is

1840
01:40:21,840 --> 01:40:23,960
seeing a lot of this

1841
01:40:23,960 --> 01:40:26,080
you know stuff that we're doing take you

1842
01:40:26,080 --> 01:40:29,920
know take on a lot of popularity and

1843
01:40:29,920 --> 01:40:32,360
stuff they're upset that we always

1844
01:40:32,360 --> 01:40:35,040
mention and troll their

1845
01:40:35,040 --> 01:40:37,920
strategies but if you listen to what

1846
01:40:37,920 --> 01:40:41,159
they do to other people it is a terrible

1847
01:40:41,159 --> 01:40:44,040
thing most of it not all of it because

1848
01:40:44,040 --> 01:40:45,719
there's other people who you know act

1849
01:40:45,719 --> 01:40:47,840
like strategy leaders too but most of it

1850
01:40:47,840 --> 01:40:49,840
comes from that

1851
01:40:49,840 --> 01:40:52,280
Community most of it comes from the ACT

1852
01:40:52,280 --> 01:40:55,040
community unfor

1853
01:40:55,040 --> 01:40:57,239
most of

1854
01:40:57,239 --> 01:41:00,599
it so for us we

1855
01:41:00,599 --> 01:41:03,560
we you know make certain to let people

1856
01:41:03,560 --> 01:41:06,440
know every strategy can

1857
01:41:06,440 --> 01:41:09,040
work it's

1858
01:41:09,040 --> 01:41:13,159
you that doesn't work every strategy out

1859
01:41:13,159 --> 01:41:15,480
there can

1860
01:41:15,480 --> 01:41:22,360
work it's you it's you it's you

1861
01:41:23,920 --> 01:41:27,320
and and we'll show alongside this is

1862
01:41:27,320 --> 01:41:29,560
what I love that stoic does we'll show

1863
01:41:29,560 --> 01:41:33,360
alongside how all of these

1864
01:41:33,360 --> 01:41:34,920
things

1865
01:41:34,920 --> 01:41:37,159
work we'll show you channels we'll show

1866
01:41:37,159 --> 01:41:38,800
you trend lines we'll show you you know

1867
01:41:38,800 --> 01:41:40,560
all of that other good stuff we we show

1868
01:41:40,560 --> 01:41:41,560
you all

1869
01:41:41,560 --> 01:41:43,960
that trust and believe we're going to

1870
01:41:43,960 --> 01:41:46,560
show it to

1871
01:41:46,639 --> 01:41:51,080
you we'll show you every bit of

1872
01:41:51,360 --> 01:41:53,599
it and show you how you you can put it

1873
01:41:53,599 --> 01:41:55,960
all together but you got to start with

1874
01:41:55,960 --> 01:41:58,080
one

1875
01:41:58,080 --> 01:42:01,920
thing you got start with one

1876
01:42:02,400 --> 01:42:06,320
thing and you work your way

1877
01:42:06,480 --> 01:42:08,599
out but if you're not good at one thing

1878
01:42:08,599 --> 01:42:10,400
you're not going to be good at anything

1879
01:42:10,400 --> 01:42:13,239
that's why we prioritize

1880
01:42:13,239 --> 01:42:16,239
structure

1881
01:42:18,560 --> 01:42:21,239
right so guys look why why am I not

1882
01:42:21,239 --> 01:42:23,840
shorting through this

1883
01:42:23,840 --> 01:42:27,880
why am I looking to go short in

1884
01:42:27,880 --> 01:42:32,199
that well based on what was said

1885
01:42:34,000 --> 01:42:38,159
already what we were

1886
01:42:38,159 --> 01:42:40,520
anticipating

1887
01:42:40,520 --> 01:42:43,920
right was for price to move back into

1888
01:42:43,920 --> 01:42:45,800
the other

1889
01:42:45,800 --> 01:42:50,040
end to a particular

1890
01:42:50,040 --> 01:42:52,800
area after something occurred to the

1891
01:42:52,800 --> 01:42:55,119
left

1892
01:42:57,760 --> 01:43:00,400
that's what we were

1893
01:43:02,719 --> 01:43:06,360
anticipating so at any

1894
01:43:06,480 --> 01:43:11,520
point we saw the pop run up above

1895
01:43:11,520 --> 01:43:17,239
that that uh um those highs in

1896
01:43:18,080 --> 01:43:21,639
there we show us run right to that line

1897
01:43:21,639 --> 01:43:24,400
and what we we stopped yeah we

1898
01:43:24,400 --> 01:43:26,040
anticipated price to take take out the

1899
01:43:26,040 --> 01:43:27,239
high of

1900
01:43:27,239 --> 01:43:28,760
it

1901
01:43:28,760 --> 01:43:33,000
but it's not our job to be 100% right

1902
01:43:33,000 --> 01:43:35,679
about what price is

1903
01:43:35,679 --> 01:43:38,360
doing it's our job to understand what

1904
01:43:38,360 --> 01:43:43,199
price is doing and find a way to get

1905
01:43:43,199 --> 01:43:45,599
involved find a way to get

1906
01:43:45,599 --> 01:43:50,679
involved so what we have

1907
01:43:50,679 --> 01:43:54,520
here is the same thing we met mentioned

1908
01:43:54,520 --> 01:43:58,080
over here

1909
01:43:59,719 --> 01:44:02,679
right I move up until I move down we

1910
01:44:02,679 --> 01:44:04,400
trade higher we go back there and then

1911
01:44:04,400 --> 01:44:06,520
we had a little push off of there right

1912
01:44:06,520 --> 01:44:07,920
and then the same thing happened inside

1913
01:44:07,920 --> 01:44:10,159
of here

1914
01:44:10,159 --> 01:44:13,520
right this move up we trade down we push

1915
01:44:13,520 --> 01:44:15,119
higher we go back here we trade higher

1916
01:44:15,119 --> 01:44:18,119
right

1917
01:44:25,000 --> 01:44:28,760
go down go up BR down trade higher go

1918
01:44:28,760 --> 01:44:29,880
back into this move and then we trade

1919
01:44:29,880 --> 01:44:33,920
higher right same thing

1920
01:44:34,119 --> 01:44:37,920
happening right same thing

1921
01:44:40,440 --> 01:44:43,280
happening

1922
01:44:43,280 --> 01:44:46,560
over and over again and all it is is up

1923
01:44:46,560 --> 01:44:48,320
to us to

1924
01:44:48,320 --> 01:44:51,400
find an opportune

1925
01:44:51,400 --> 01:44:55,599
time to be able to end enter into the

1926
01:44:55,920 --> 01:44:59,159
market enter into the market

1927
01:44:59,159 --> 01:45:01,800
right and take something off the table

1928
01:45:01,800 --> 01:45:03,679
take something out of

1929
01:45:03,679 --> 01:45:07,800
there take a little profit off

1930
01:45:08,480 --> 01:45:11,719
of table rather than being right about

1931
01:45:11,719 --> 01:45:15,000
whether a weekly draw is going to happen

1932
01:45:15,000 --> 01:45:16,760
rather than being right about whether a

1933
01:45:16,760 --> 01:45:19,360
daily whatever is going to

1934
01:45:19,360 --> 01:45:24,760
happen just a couple minutes a day

1935
01:45:25,040 --> 01:45:27,719
couple minutes a

1936
01:45:28,599 --> 01:45:31,280
day and there will be times that we are

1937
01:45:31,280 --> 01:45:33,960
wrong that's

1938
01:45:34,560 --> 01:45:37,239
fine but if we continue to execute based

1939
01:45:37,239 --> 01:45:40,840
on what our plan tells us to

1940
01:45:40,840 --> 01:45:43,760
do then

1941
01:45:43,760 --> 01:45:47,480
Viola we in there like

1942
01:45:51,599 --> 01:45:53,520
swimwear what do you about the new

1943
01:45:53,520 --> 01:45:55,000
Futures I don't know nothing about prop

1944
01:45:55,000 --> 01:45:58,000
firms don't ask me anything about prop

1945
01:45:58,000 --> 01:46:00,639
firms um the good old question are you

1946
01:46:00,639 --> 01:46:02,880
trying to be right 100% of the time are

1947
01:46:02,880 --> 01:46:04,480
you trying to make money and I ask that

1948
01:46:04,480 --> 01:46:06,239
question all the time because it's a

1949
01:46:06,239 --> 01:46:08,239
question that's

1950
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:10,400
true you want to be right or you want to

1951
01:46:10,400 --> 01:46:12,080
make money which

1952
01:46:12,080 --> 01:46:14,400
one which

1953
01:46:14,400 --> 01:46:17,760
one which one matters more you want to

1954
01:46:17,760 --> 01:46:22,840
be right you want to make money

1955
01:46:23,080 --> 01:46:25,800
the question is

1956
01:46:27,960 --> 01:46:33,400
simple and you're greed

1957
01:46:34,719 --> 01:46:38,080
is you know something that

1958
01:46:38,080 --> 01:46:41,679
determines the outcome of

1959
01:46:41,679 --> 01:46:44,159
that say I've been a longtime follower

1960
01:46:44,159 --> 01:46:46,719
of I I was terrified by yesterday's I

1961
01:46:46,719 --> 01:46:49,400
breing so I I watched it a little bit he

1962
01:46:49,400 --> 01:46:52,320
was explaining some things you know on

1963
01:46:52,320 --> 01:46:54,639
on some other pairs like da and and he

1964
01:46:54,639 --> 01:46:56,199
was also teaching yesterday I was

1965
01:46:56,199 --> 01:46:58,679
teaching too you know I was teaching

1966
01:46:58,679 --> 01:47:00,000
about something entirely different of

1967
01:47:00,000 --> 01:47:03,040
course but I was teaching yesterday as

1968
01:47:03,040 --> 01:47:05,719
well and maybe it's in an environment

1969
01:47:05,719 --> 01:47:07,719
where it's best for him to

1970
01:47:07,719 --> 01:47:09,840
teach you know there there are some

1971
01:47:09,840 --> 01:47:11,719
environments that I really don't like to

1972
01:47:11,719 --> 01:47:14,520
trade in in in super trending

1973
01:47:14,520 --> 01:47:17,280
environments I'll take a step

1974
01:47:17,280 --> 01:47:20,800
out I honor my experience and take a

1975
01:47:20,800 --> 01:47:24,040
step out

1976
01:47:24,080 --> 01:47:26,119
in in trending

1977
01:47:26,119 --> 01:47:28,199
environments maybe in more or less

1978
01:47:28,199 --> 01:47:30,400
ranged environments he he wants to take

1979
01:47:30,400 --> 01:47:31,679
a step

1980
01:47:31,679 --> 01:47:34,880
back I can understand

1981
01:47:34,880 --> 01:47:40,639
that and would would prefer to to uh uh

1982
01:47:41,760 --> 01:47:45,800
teach so you know with that it it's just

1983
01:47:45,800 --> 01:47:48,560
whatever the strong suit is of of the

1984
01:47:48,560 --> 01:47:52,040
Traer itself

1985
01:47:53,280 --> 01:47:54,520
what will you do if trading won't be

1986
01:47:54,520 --> 01:47:57,639
allowed anymore um trading is how the

1987
01:47:57,639 --> 01:48:00,239
whole world is

1988
01:48:00,960 --> 01:48:04,199
ran like you got to remember these these

1989
01:48:04,199 --> 01:48:06,119
um these things that we're looking at

1990
01:48:06,119 --> 01:48:09,119
like we have um you know oil over here

1991
01:48:09,119 --> 01:48:11,719
we have gold here you we have wheat we

1992
01:48:11,719 --> 01:48:15,239
have rice got y'all have y'all seen

1993
01:48:15,239 --> 01:48:17,880
Rice have have

1994
01:48:17,880 --> 01:48:20,400
y'all sto over here talking about I was

1995
01:48:20,400 --> 01:48:23,360
I was sharing rice proper Ganda with

1996
01:48:23,360 --> 01:48:26,480
y'all no have y'all seen

1997
01:48:27,760 --> 01:48:30,800
rice listen I was buying up some R

1998
01:48:30,800 --> 01:48:31,880
that's why I got this area here I was

1999
01:48:31,880 --> 01:48:35,040
buying up some rice in in that area

2000
01:48:35,040 --> 01:48:37,520
there buying up some

2001
01:48:37,520 --> 01:48:42,239
rice because what you see is is I was

2002
01:48:42,239 --> 01:48:44,280
watching for rice to go higher up above

2003
01:48:44,280 --> 01:48:46,480
this

2004
01:48:47,239 --> 01:48:50,639
high that high right there 2023

2005
01:48:50,639 --> 01:48:53,520
high and we have R dro a little lower I

2006
01:48:53,520 --> 01:48:55,560
was a little afraid you know I I was

2007
01:48:55,560 --> 01:48:57,280
going Target

2008
01:48:57,280 --> 01:48:59,440
filled I was I was going to get out of

2009
01:48:59,440 --> 01:49:01,520
my my

2010
01:49:01,520 --> 01:49:04,199
trade right here I start selling rights

2011
01:49:04,199 --> 01:49:11,080
on eBay but nothing you know uh

2012
01:49:12,119 --> 01:49:15,760
um we we held the zone you see it 50% of

2013
01:49:15,760 --> 01:49:17,920
the Zone we held it and look at how rice

2014
01:49:17,920 --> 01:49:20,719
is right back up here again we have

2015
01:49:20,719 --> 01:49:21,880
plenty of videos on YouTube and

2016
01:49:21,880 --> 01:49:24,719
following rice

2017
01:49:26,480 --> 01:49:30,159
so Ry has a possibility of of getting

2018
01:49:30,159 --> 01:49:34,719
back up to that that 2020 high and I

2019
01:49:34,719 --> 01:49:37,679
mean that's going to be

2020
01:49:37,679 --> 01:49:40,560
expensive so I enter my position here in

2021
01:49:40,560 --> 01:49:42,440
my

2022
01:49:42,440 --> 01:49:46,280
garage quite a bit of bags of rice in

2023
01:49:46,280 --> 01:49:50,280
here into my position here

2024
01:49:50,280 --> 01:49:53,159
and do you see that

2025
01:49:53,159 --> 01:49:55,360
we're back up to here again I told you

2026
01:49:55,360 --> 01:49:58,880
guys start buying up some of these

2027
01:49:58,880 --> 01:50:02,320
things these these uh uh you know things

2028
01:50:02,320 --> 01:50:04,840
that that do not expire you know as fast

2029
01:50:04,840 --> 01:50:07,880
as fruit or find ways to preserve them

2030
01:50:07,880 --> 01:50:10,080
or or whatever it

2031
01:50:10,080 --> 01:50:12,920
is find ways to preserve

2032
01:50:12,920 --> 01:50:16,880
them because when prices get higher

2033
01:50:16,880 --> 01:50:19,040
you're not caught

2034
01:50:19,040 --> 01:50:20,760
in you

2035
01:50:20,760 --> 01:50:23,679
know now needing to pay a lot more for

2036
01:50:23,679 --> 01:50:26,679
something that two weeks ago you paid a

2037
01:50:26,679 --> 01:50:29,159
lot less

2038
01:50:29,159 --> 01:50:31,760
for two weeks ago you paid a lot less

2039
01:50:31,760 --> 01:50:33,960
for

2040
01:50:36,239 --> 01:50:39,000
it we actually might be looking for that

2041
01:50:39,000 --> 01:50:42,520
48 up there on enq um two weeks ago you

2042
01:50:42,520 --> 01:50:44,639
paid a lot less for it but look at that

2043
01:50:44,639 --> 01:50:47,599
it had this move down back in here hit

2044
01:50:47,599 --> 01:50:50,360
the 50% of the Zone there my stop loss

2045
01:50:50,360 --> 01:50:52,159
was right behind here because then I've

2046
01:50:52,159 --> 01:50:53,840
been in and draw down because I was

2047
01:50:53,840 --> 01:50:55,119
buying from down

2048
01:50:55,119 --> 01:50:59,719
here and look at that move

2049
01:51:01,320 --> 01:51:05,199
higher that's going to cost

2050
01:51:05,280 --> 01:51:09,079
somebody but I know I got enough rice

2051
01:51:09,079 --> 01:51:11,440
for got enough right for them to take

2052
01:51:11,440 --> 01:51:13,679
that that high there and then drop back

2053
01:51:13,679 --> 01:51:15,520
into the Zone there and now you know

2054
01:51:15,520 --> 01:51:17,880
prices cool down again now we can add

2055
01:51:17,880 --> 01:51:20,440
into our

2056
01:51:21,000 --> 01:51:23,239
position before possibility of it

2057
01:51:23,239 --> 01:51:25,920
spiking up

2058
01:51:27,280 --> 01:51:29,639
again well maybe when it take that you

2059
01:51:29,639 --> 01:51:32,760
drop right back into the 50% of the Zone

2060
01:51:32,760 --> 01:51:36,320
here so may we get back to the

2061
01:51:36,320 --> 01:51:38,679
entry I'm going to have another pump off

2062
01:51:38,679 --> 01:51:41,520
of it but if it's a strong Trend what

2063
01:51:41,520 --> 01:51:44,679
you see is price pop out of here and

2064
01:51:44,679 --> 01:51:46,199
continue higher you won't see it get

2065
01:51:46,199 --> 01:51:47,800
back to the

2066
01:51:47,800 --> 01:51:52,480
50% is a strong trend

2067
01:51:54,000 --> 01:51:55,880
so long as we get a double top somewhere

2068
01:51:55,880 --> 01:51:57,840
in here then that's where we could run

2069
01:51:57,840 --> 01:52:00,000
that low that we put in after this high

2070
01:52:00,000 --> 01:52:01,679
is taken and then potentially look to

2071
01:52:01,679 --> 01:52:04,360
Target this low too hopefully you know

2072
01:52:04,360 --> 01:52:07,199
it's it don't go down that way where

2073
01:52:07,199 --> 01:52:08,880
price runs higher because it's going to

2074
01:52:08,880 --> 01:52:10,400
hurt a lot of

2075
01:52:10,400 --> 01:52:13,320
people but these charts are not just for

2076
01:52:13,320 --> 01:52:14,880
taking little small entries off and

2077
01:52:14,880 --> 01:52:17,000
taking little trades off

2078
01:52:17,000 --> 01:52:23,079
of oh yes I want it my TP hit no this is

2079
01:52:23,079 --> 01:52:24,960
for planning your

2080
01:52:24,960 --> 01:52:28,639
life you've access to this data to plan

2081
01:52:28,639 --> 01:52:30,920
your

2082
01:52:32,079 --> 01:52:35,719
life there 48 look look like we still

2083
01:52:35,719 --> 01:52:38,880
going above to that 48

2084
01:52:38,880 --> 01:52:43,360
right so let me let me put an alert

2085
01:52:47,040 --> 01:52:50,079
there the

2086
01:52:50,079 --> 01:52:53,639
48 you been putting alarm there

2087
01:52:53,639 --> 01:52:57,920
it let us know when it gets

2088
01:53:00,440 --> 01:53:03,440
there

2089
01:53:07,480 --> 01:53:11,000
because somebody went

2090
01:53:16,079 --> 01:53:18,239
short gold tapped into the previous

2091
01:53:18,239 --> 01:53:20,599
day's high after taking the

2092
01:53:20,599 --> 01:53:24,440
low um

2093
01:53:26,400 --> 01:53:29,079
gold oh yeah gold had that extension

2094
01:53:29,079 --> 01:53:31,960
overnight that was a news from Iran and

2095
01:53:31,960 --> 01:53:35,880
Israel Israel had

01:53:36,960 --> 01:53:40,400
um bombed Iran same thing with this here

2097
01:53:40,400 --> 01:53:43,960
too uh oil oil had that same push

2098
01:53:43,960 --> 01:53:46,639
overnight as

2099
01:53:47,320 --> 01:53:50,079
well I was talking to my kid and I was

2100
01:53:50,079 --> 01:53:51,440
teaching them how

2101
01:53:51,440 --> 01:53:54,920
to spot some of this stuff and trade it

2102
01:53:54,920 --> 01:53:58,079
and I said listen this is oil like oil

2103
01:53:58,079 --> 01:54:00,199
real time yeah it's oil you can trade

2104
01:54:00,199 --> 01:54:02,360
oil so he like how you know when it's

2105
01:54:02,360 --> 01:54:04,960
going to go up and down

2106
01:54:04,960 --> 01:54:07,760
well here's the

2107
01:54:07,760 --> 01:54:11,040
thing I don't want to brag but but then

2108
01:54:11,040 --> 01:54:12,480
I realized I was talking to my kids so I

2109
01:54:12,480 --> 01:54:14,159
was like hold on let me let me let me

2110
01:54:14,159 --> 01:54:17,119
take you take you in I say you see this

2111
01:54:17,119 --> 01:54:19,560
move going up into this move going down

2112
01:54:19,560 --> 01:54:21,040
that area that it leaves behind as a

2113
01:54:21,040 --> 01:54:25,840
Zone like that open space yeah there a

2114
01:54:25,840 --> 01:54:28,119
zone are there any zones down there I

2115
01:54:28,119 --> 01:54:29,280
said yeah there's some zones down there

2116
01:54:29,280 --> 01:54:31,320
too but what we focusing on is this when

2117
01:54:31,320 --> 01:54:34,360
we get there you know when to short to

2118
01:54:34,360 --> 01:54:36,760
take price down when we get there you

2119
01:54:36,760 --> 01:54:39,199
know when the long to take price up and

2120
01:54:39,199 --> 01:54:41,400
all it depends on is how much you think

2121
01:54:41,400 --> 01:54:44,079
is enough when you do take these entries

2122
01:54:44,079 --> 01:54:47,360
but you got to know where to get in when

2123
01:54:47,360 --> 01:54:49,840
to get it so this oil right before

2124
01:54:49,840 --> 01:54:52,520
stream I had marked this up I was like

2125
01:54:52,520 --> 01:54:53,800
go right there and then you going to see

2126
01:54:53,800 --> 01:54:55,679
it move away from

2127
01:54:55,679 --> 01:54:58,040
there i' been confident talking to my

2128
01:54:58,040 --> 01:54:59,679
kid I'm like Hey listen you think it's

2129
01:54:59,679 --> 01:55:03,239
going to go down up let's let's make a

2130
01:55:03,239 --> 01:55:06,159
bet let's make a

2131
01:55:06,159 --> 01:55:10,320
bet you know them cookies you bought

2132
01:55:10,320 --> 01:55:13,480
you the organic chocolate chip cookies

2133
01:55:13,480 --> 01:55:16,840
let's make a bet about

2134
01:55:17,760 --> 01:55:23,360
it I'm fan competition ain't that

2135
01:55:25,239 --> 01:55:27,480
unfair

2136
01:55:27,480 --> 01:55:29,840
competition hey look at that yo price

2137
01:55:29,840 --> 01:55:31,880
price just they they just don't want me

2138
01:55:31,880 --> 01:55:33,679
to

2139
01:55:33,679 --> 01:55:38,119
win so let me move them and take profit

2140
01:55:38,119 --> 01:55:42,079
up they just don't want me to

2141
01:55:42,840 --> 01:55:47,119
win so yeah is it's

2142
01:55:47,119 --> 01:55:51,119
um but you still trade those news with

2143
01:55:51,119 --> 01:55:52,560
your rules I don't know what you talking

01:55:52,560 --> 01:55:56,560
about um you shouldn't trade any news at

all that's what I personally

2146
01:56:01,480 --> 01:56:04,719

the upper

2150
01:56:14,159 --> 01:56:17,760
hand and every time I eat those cookies

2151
01:56:17,760 --> 01:56:20,520

2277
02:05:39,199 --> 02:05:42,079
people I how to tell them a lie and make

2278
02:05:42,079 --> 02:05:44,719
them think is the truth so they would

2279
02:05:44,719 --> 02:05:47,400
feel good about it rather than learning

2280
02:05:47,400 --> 02:05:49,199
uncomfortable truths about themselves

2281
02:05:49,199 --> 02:05:51,079

2282
02:05:51,079 --> 02:05:53,840

coach this

2288
02:06:08,079 --> 02:06:12,320
is this is

2289
02:06:32,540 --> 02:06:42,360
[Music]

2290
02:06:42,360 --> 02:06:45,599
all right all right all right so I I

2291
02:06:45,599 --> 02:06:47,320
think that this is

2292
02:06:47,320 --> 02:06:50,280
um a perfect way to and I did tell y'all

2293
02:06:50,280 --> 02:06:54,360
I said um we get back above here I said

2294
02:06:54,360 --> 02:06:57,320
once we get into this Zone here you more

2295
02:06:57,320 --> 02:07:00,040
than likely see a rejection within here

2296
02:07:00,040 --> 02:07:02,280
and that rejection will let us know you

2297
02:07:02,280 --> 02:07:04,079
know whether price wants to trade higher

2298
02:07:04,079 --> 02:07:07,400
to here now it would be pure greed to be

2299
02:07:07,400 --> 02:07:10,239
in an entry here and go to try and

2300
02:07:10,239 --> 02:07:13,719
Target this High here be pure greed why

2301
02:07:13,719 --> 02:07:16,280
because there's no structural shifting

2302
02:07:16,280 --> 02:07:18,280
that's taking place as of yet what do I

2303
02:07:18,280 --> 02:07:20,679
mean by that I mean that as we're

2304
02:07:20,679 --> 02:07:22,679
putting in these highs and lows heading

2305
02:07:22,679 --> 02:07:25,239
up right we put in that low we put in

2306
02:07:25,239 --> 02:07:27,920
this low here put another high here when

2307
02:07:27,920 --> 02:07:30,400
we trade it below here there's no body

2308
02:07:30,400 --> 02:07:32,920
closure below this low so this high is

2309
02:07:32,920 --> 02:07:34,119
not

2310
02:07:34,119 --> 02:07:36,679
validated so what we had was a quick

2311
02:07:36,679 --> 02:07:39,719
shift below and the body pulled back

2312
02:07:39,719 --> 02:07:44,239
up so that right there becomes a down

2313
02:07:44,239 --> 02:07:46,239
candle that took a low that could send

2314
02:07:46,239 --> 02:07:48,320
price higher and what take out the high

2315
02:07:48,320 --> 02:07:50,800
that's not a part of structure so what

2316
02:07:50,800 --> 02:07:52,199
did we go and do

2317
02:07:52,199 --> 02:07:56,079
we trade it up to tap onto

2318
02:07:56,079 --> 02:08:01,280
What tap onto the low that did produce a

2319
02:08:01,280 --> 02:08:04,760
high right you see this this High missed

2320
02:08:04,760 --> 02:08:06,599
it let me just move some of these

2321
02:08:06,599 --> 02:08:08,960
drawings

2322
02:08:09,159 --> 02:08:12,000
out this oh come

2323
02:08:12,000 --> 02:08:16,480
on this High missed it right

2324
02:08:17,920 --> 02:08:20,880
here that high missed it but this High

2325
02:08:20,880 --> 02:08:22,920
hit it

2326
02:08:22,920 --> 02:08:26,079
so what it's actually hitting

2327
02:08:26,079 --> 02:08:29,679
is that little tiny Zone inside of there

2328
02:08:29,679 --> 02:08:31,599
tapped right into it you see another

2329
02:08:31,599 --> 02:08:34,840
move down now this

2330
02:08:34,840 --> 02:08:39,599
becomes the validated high right sorry

2331
02:08:39,599 --> 02:08:42,079
the the protected high and this was a

2332
02:08:42,079 --> 02:08:44,440
validated low moving back into that why

2333
02:08:44,440 --> 02:08:46,079
is it a validated low because it put in

2334
02:08:46,079 --> 02:08:48,480
a low and closed up above the previous

2335
02:08:48,480 --> 02:08:50,599
candle's high now putting in a low and

2336
02:08:50,599 --> 02:08:51,639
closing up above the previous previous

2337
02:08:51,639 --> 02:08:55,400
candles high does not mean that because

2338
02:08:55,400 --> 02:08:58,880
this low traded below the previous low

2339
02:08:58,880 --> 02:09:01,360
and did not close that doesn't classify

2340
02:09:01,360 --> 02:09:03,079
as a low it could still classify as a

2341
02:09:03,079 --> 02:09:06,520
low if it moves up and puts in a closure

2342
02:09:06,520 --> 02:09:08,360
above that high then you see us move

2343
02:09:08,360 --> 02:09:10,119
back down below it so all all we're

2344
02:09:10,119 --> 02:09:11,760
doing

2345
02:09:11,760 --> 02:09:14,559
is when we're focusing on these swings

2346
02:09:14,559 --> 02:09:16,960
heading down this just becomes the third

2347
02:09:16,960 --> 02:09:20,920
swing in this down move right here so

2348
02:09:20,920 --> 02:09:23,400
you in anticipate through here another

2349
02:09:23,400 --> 02:09:25,639
move back into there and should we get

2350
02:09:25,639 --> 02:09:28,639
stuck putting an equal low here then you

2351
02:09:28,639 --> 02:09:31,040
can see that go back up to take out this

2352
02:09:31,040 --> 02:09:35,719
high and why would it take out that high

2353
02:09:36,400 --> 02:09:41,800
because that high into that low right

2354
02:09:41,800 --> 02:09:44,159
here remember what we talked

2355
02:09:44,159 --> 02:09:48,040
about the larger structure we were

2356
02:09:48,040 --> 02:09:51,440
following right the larger structure we

2357
02:09:51,440 --> 02:09:53,239
were following so we know that this

2358
02:09:53,239 --> 02:09:57,719
could in turn move back up to put in a

2359
02:09:57,719 --> 02:10:00,199
fourth High we have one we have two we

2360
02:10:00,199 --> 02:10:03,040
have three so four to six then we expect

2361
02:10:03,040 --> 02:10:06,639
price to reverse right so we're still

2362
02:10:06,639 --> 02:10:09,880
trading down into this this structure we

2363
02:10:09,880 --> 02:10:13,599
came out of but what we're following is

2364
02:10:13,599 --> 02:10:16,719
the higher time frame highs and lows and

2365
02:10:16,719 --> 02:10:19,760
what we're taking little entries off of

2366
02:10:19,760 --> 02:10:23,199
are what makes up those higher time

2367
02:10:23,199 --> 02:10:25,480
frame highs and lows because what

2368
02:10:25,480 --> 02:10:28,960
happens is if we end up taking a short

2369
02:10:28,960 --> 02:10:30,840
out of these areas look at how long you

2370
02:10:30,840 --> 02:10:33,239
stay around in in that short before

2371
02:10:33,239 --> 02:10:36,000
price actually leaves the area and then

2372
02:10:36,000 --> 02:10:38,079
when price gets down here and moves back

2373
02:10:38,079 --> 02:10:41,440
up to there again now it's just right

2374
02:10:41,440 --> 02:10:43,800
back to your entry or right near your

2375
02:10:43,800 --> 02:10:46,280
entry for you to want to get price to

2376
02:10:46,280 --> 02:10:47,719
push away potentially if you're

2377
02:10:47,719 --> 02:10:51,520
targeting this sell side right here

2378
02:10:51,520 --> 02:10:53,960
you would take some time in that

2379
02:10:53,960 --> 02:10:56,480
entry rather than just being able to

2380
02:10:56,480 --> 02:10:58,719
find these little moves within price and

2381
02:10:58,719 --> 02:11:00,520
you can create your own 100 Point moves

2382
02:11:00,520 --> 02:11:01,719
inside of here you don't need to be a

2383
02:11:01,719 --> 02:11:03,960
part of a move that you held it all the

2384
02:11:03,960 --> 02:11:05,880
way for 100 point you can create that

2385
02:11:05,880 --> 02:11:07,040
for

2386
02:11:07,040 --> 02:11:09,559
yourself you know and I think that's the

2387
02:11:09,559 --> 02:11:11,719
the the demons that a lot of people

2388
02:11:11,719 --> 02:11:13,800
fight they want more but they don't

2389
02:11:13,800 --> 02:11:16,079
understand that they can create more if

2390
02:11:16,079 --> 02:11:20,079
they learned more right you can create

2391
02:11:20,079 --> 02:11:23,880
more if you learn more you never need to

2392
02:11:23,880 --> 02:11:26,239
be a part of holding the move from the

2393
02:11:26,239 --> 02:11:28,400
top other people other systems they

2394
02:11:28,400 --> 02:11:30,679
might do that stuff and some days when

2395
02:11:30,679 --> 02:11:32,280
they can't find a move that delivers

2396
02:11:32,280 --> 02:11:35,199
that they're out of the market every day

2397
02:11:35,199 --> 02:11:37,960
you can find a move utilizing what it is

2398
02:11:37,960 --> 02:11:42,480
that we teach here every

2399
02:11:42,679 --> 02:11:44,960
day no matter what's happening in the

2400
02:11:44,960 --> 02:11:46,679
market oh this is a bad day to trade

2401
02:11:46,679 --> 02:11:48,040
because what something happened in

2402
02:11:48,040 --> 02:11:49,880
another country and we have no idea

2403
02:11:49,880 --> 02:11:51,239
what's what the response is going to

2404
02:11:51,239 --> 02:11:52,239
going to

2405
02:11:52,239 --> 02:11:55,559
be okay and and if you go back if you

2406
02:11:55,559 --> 02:11:57,679
let's let's go back to

2407
02:11:57,679 --> 02:12:00,239
to let's go back to Dow

2408
02:12:00,239 --> 02:12:03,639
Jones oh we have we had no idea you kof

2409
02:12:03,639 --> 02:12:06,159
was going to take place but was that

2410
02:12:06,159 --> 02:12:08,239
tradeable coming out of it yes oh we we

2411
02:12:08,239 --> 02:12:11,280
had no idea that the 2008 crash going to

2412
02:12:11,280 --> 02:12:13,679
take did did we did we come out of that

2413
02:12:13,679 --> 02:12:16,040
too oh we had no

2414
02:12:16,040 --> 02:12:18,520
idea Black Monday and all that other

2415
02:12:18,520 --> 02:12:20,719
stuff is is take but but did we come out

2416
02:12:20,719 --> 02:12:22,800
of there was there a way to trade our

2417
02:12:22,800 --> 02:12:26,199
way out those large moves they're not

2418
02:12:26,199 --> 02:12:29,159
for us that's not our money in those

2419
02:12:29,159 --> 02:12:30,679
large moves but we need to understand

2420
02:12:30,679 --> 02:12:33,000
that every time those things

2421
02:12:33,000 --> 02:12:37,280
happen we have opportunity now but

2422
02:12:37,280 --> 02:12:39,440
should we be highly leveraged and fatten

2423
02:12:39,440 --> 02:12:42,760
up at this High we lose

2424
02:12:42,760 --> 02:12:46,559
everything going that way

2425
02:12:46,559 --> 02:12:49,719
everything because we want higher prices

2426
02:12:49,719 --> 02:12:52,480
price dips back and then trades up above

2427
02:12:52,480 --> 02:12:54,760
trades right back above there Taps back

2428
02:12:54,760 --> 02:12:56,679
into it and then trades higher that's

2429
02:12:56,679 --> 02:12:58,679
the thing that we mentioned on

2430
02:12:58,679 --> 02:13:00,960
rice has the possibility of taking that

2431
02:13:00,960 --> 02:13:02,639
high tapping back in and then trading

2432
02:13:02,639 --> 02:13:04,400
higher on

2433
02:13:04,400 --> 02:13:06,920
Rice you do that with gold do that with

2434
02:13:06,920 --> 02:13:08,840
whatever it is that that's connected to

2435
02:13:08,840 --> 02:13:11,400
your daily living so it's time for you

2436
02:13:11,400 --> 02:13:14,480
to learn what you need to learn and do

2437
02:13:14,480 --> 02:13:16,079
what you have to do so you can do what

2438
02:13:16,079 --> 02:13:17,320
you want to

2439
02:13:17,320 --> 02:13:20,000
do and I I'll continue to say it over

2440
02:13:20,000 --> 02:13:22,760
and over again fast scalping sorry is

2441
02:13:22,760 --> 02:13:27,400
the fastest way to to any sort of

2442
02:13:27,400 --> 02:13:28,800
acceleration of

2443
02:13:28,800 --> 02:13:33,079
wealth scalping learning how to scalp

2444
02:13:33,079 --> 02:13:34,760
this is one of the most liquid markets

2445
02:13:34,760 --> 02:13:37,360
in the world yet people think they need

2446
02:13:37,360 --> 02:13:41,199
to be in a move from up here holding the

2447
02:13:41,199 --> 02:13:44,239
move all the way from up

2448
02:13:44,239 --> 02:13:47,199
here and they need to be in it heading

2449
02:13:47,199 --> 02:13:50,239
all the way down to this low like you

2450
02:13:50,239 --> 02:13:53,599
some Allstar fund manager that

2451
02:13:53,599 --> 02:13:56,159
that you know you you trying to win an

2452

you're trying to save your life you're

2455
02:14:03,639 --> 02:14:05,440
trying to save

2456
02:14:05,440 --> 02:14:08,199
yourself that's what it is is is it's in

2457
02:14:08,199 --> 02:14:11,360
the details of these things that you're

2458
02:14:11,360 --> 02:14:13,559
going to learn how to operate within the

2459
02:14:13,559 --> 02:14:15,440
details of

2460
02:14:15,440 --> 02:14:18,239
them and then what what's that part of

2461
02:14:18,239 --> 02:14:20,800
risk management that we talked about the

2462
02:14:20,800 --> 02:14:22,280
part risk management that we talked

2463
02:14:22,280 --> 02:14:25,199
about was paying yourself that needs to

2464
02:14:25,199 --> 02:14:27,239
be a

2465
02:14:27,239 --> 02:14:30,159
Cornerstone a

2466
02:14:30,159 --> 02:14:35,719
Cornerstone in your risk management a

2467
02:14:35,719 --> 02:14:39,840
Cornerstone needs to be to pay yourself

2468
02:14:39,840 --> 02:14:42,040
you don't have to be a part of every

2469
02:14:42,040 --> 02:14:45,760
single move that's inside of here you

2470
02:14:45,760 --> 02:14:48,040
never need to be a part of every single

2471
02:14:48,040 --> 02:14:49,800
move you can

2472
02:14:49,800 --> 02:14:51,960
find you you can just find yourself in

2473
02:14:51,960 --> 02:14:54,760
one or two moves take little short

2474
02:14:54,760 --> 02:14:56,480
scalps within

2475
02:14:56,480 --> 02:14:59,840
there and and walk out for the day I had

2476
02:14:59,840 --> 02:15:01,639
a guy in the Discord that said he was up

2477
02:15:01,639 --> 02:15:03,480
$620 on a

2478
02:15:03,480 --> 02:15:05,599
day yeah I'm going to come back in an

2479
02:15:05,599 --> 02:15:07,480
hour for what you should come back

2480
02:15:07,480 --> 02:15:09,480
tomorrow because if you go out there you

2481
02:15:09,480 --> 02:15:12,440
have no credentials you have no skill

2482
02:15:12,440 --> 02:15:14,639
you have no degrees that's going to

2483
02:15:14,639 --> 02:15:19,520
support a job ever paying you

2484
02:15:19,520 --> 02:15:23,599
$620 for the little bit of minutes you

2485
02:15:23,599 --> 02:15:26,440
traded to make this so come back

2486
02:15:26,440 --> 02:15:29,280
tomorrow that's

2487
02:15:29,280 --> 02:15:31,400
greed I I don't know if he came back

2488
02:15:31,400 --> 02:15:33,960
tomorrow I can't you tell you what

2489
02:15:33,960 --> 02:15:38,000
happened I hope he listened you

2490
02:15:38,000 --> 02:15:40,520
know but you can find these little

2491
02:15:40,520 --> 02:15:42,040
things within

2492
02:15:42,040 --> 02:15:44,599
price pay yourself more than a job would

2493
02:15:44,599 --> 02:15:46,760
ever pay you what whatever skill or

2494
02:15:46,760 --> 02:15:48,440
credential you have and then just come

2495
02:15:48,440 --> 02:15:51,040
back the next day

2496
02:15:51,040 --> 02:15:54,520
was 400 bucks today and 400 bucks

2497
02:15:54,520 --> 02:15:58,639
tomorrow 400 bucks each day two 300

2498
02:15:58,639 --> 02:16:00,400
bucks each day what's that that replaces

2499
02:16:00,400 --> 02:16:03,040
your entire

2500
02:16:05,159 --> 02:16:06,760
salary

2501
02:16:06,760 --> 02:16:10,880
so that should always be the

2502
02:16:10,920 --> 02:16:13,639
goal you know and you don't have to be a

2503
02:16:13,639 --> 02:16:17,199
part of everything to make that just

2504
02:16:17,199 --> 02:16:20,280
simple things know when we're in a Range

2505
02:16:20,280 --> 02:16:22,079
trade based on a

2506
02:16:22,079 --> 02:16:26,199
range have clear

2507
02:16:28,719 --> 02:16:32,318
exits and say hey this is enough no job

2508
02:16:32,318 --> 02:16:34,799
would ever pay me more than this so I'll

2509
02:16:34,799 --> 02:16:36,799
come back to work

2510
02:16:36,799 --> 02:16:39,799
tomorrow

2511
02:16:41,040 --> 02:16:44,679
right and you know that that solves a

2512
02:16:44,679 --> 02:16:48,760
lot of your your financial hardship and

2513
02:16:48,760 --> 02:16:51,879
now you get to focus on life

2514
02:16:51,879 --> 02:16:53,840
now you get to focus on cleaning those

2515
02:16:53,840 --> 02:16:57,638
things up that you've been carrying that

2516
02:16:57,638 --> 02:17:01,318
you have not even been able to stop and

2517
02:17:01,318 --> 02:17:03,638
address whether it's things at home with

2518
02:17:03,638 --> 02:17:04,920
your partner whether it's things with

2519
02:17:04,920 --> 02:17:07,200
your kids whoever it is you have enough

2520
02:17:07,200 --> 02:17:10,280
time now to stop and deal with

2521
02:17:10,280 --> 02:17:13,638
them before they get

2522
02:17:13,638 --> 02:17:16,959
worse cuz life is not about

2523
02:17:16,959 --> 02:17:21,959
money it's about the time that you spend

2524
02:17:21,959 --> 02:17:24,318
with your loved ones the time you spend

2525
02:17:24,318 --> 02:17:27,000
with your Offspring whoever it is the

2526
02:17:27,000 --> 02:17:29,638
time you spend with those close to you

2527
02:17:29,638 --> 02:17:31,638
that's what life is about because when

2528
02:17:31,638 --> 02:17:32,718
you're

2529
02:17:32,718 --> 02:17:35,879
gone tomorrow that same bus that you

02:17:35,879 --> 02:17:39,718

2533
02:17:45,599 --> 02:17:48,679
to do the same news channels you love to

2534
02:17:48,679 --> 02:17:51,439
watch that movie that was schedule for

2535
02:17:51,439 --> 02:17:54,519
next week guess what it's still going to

2536
02:17:54,519 --> 02:17:57,398
show up it's still going to keep running

2537
02:17:57,398 --> 02:17:59,040
that movie is still going to drop

2538
02:17:59,040 --> 02:18:01,599
whether you dead or alive but guess

2539
02:18:01,599 --> 02:18:05,080
whose World

2540
02:18:05,080 --> 02:18:08,760
changes guess who whose World changes

2541
02:18:08,760 --> 02:18:12,080
the people you left

2542
02:18:13,318 --> 02:18:18,318
behind the people you left

2543
02:18:18,318 --> 02:18:20,840
behind I don't have enough money to die

2544
02:18:20,840 --> 02:18:22,840
and have my kids never depend on anybody

2545
02:18:22,840 --> 02:18:25,080
else

2546
02:18:25,080 --> 02:18:28,000
again I don't have enough possessions to

2547
02:18:28,000 --> 02:18:30,000
die and my kids never depend on anybody

2548
02:18:30,000 --> 02:18:33,000
else again that's the goal in life I

2549
02:18:33,000 --> 02:18:35,080
don't care if I have to die trying I

2550
02:18:35,080 --> 02:18:37,638
don't care if I don't get to rest while

2551
02:18:37,638 --> 02:18:39,599
in pursuit of

2552
02:18:39,599 --> 02:18:42,080
it they should never have to depend on

2553
02:18:42,080 --> 02:18:43,679
anybody else for shelter they should

2554
02:18:43,679 --> 02:18:45,799
never have to depend on a job to pay

2555
02:18:45,799 --> 02:18:49,398
them peanuts and treat them like their

2556
02:18:49,398 --> 02:18:51,959
mules

2557
02:18:51,959 --> 02:18:53,519
they should have choice in what they

2558
02:18:53,519 --> 02:18:55,799
want to do in life what they love to do

2559
02:18:55,799 --> 02:18:59,199
how they want to give back to

2560
02:19:00,599 --> 02:19:04,240
humanity so that's the drive for me

2561
02:19:04,240 --> 02:19:06,959
that's what keeps me coming back and I

2562
02:19:06,959 --> 02:19:08,638
know there's people out there in

2563
