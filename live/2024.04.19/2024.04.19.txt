[Music]

wow what's up y'all

morning morning

morning listen every

day is a good morning every day you want

to know

why because you can't put an alarm clock

in the

graveyard and they wake

up so for some of y'all lazy ones that

got to set the alarm to wake yourself up

and your body hasn't set it for you as

of yet

it's a beautiful thing to wake up every

day so uh let me see somebody said the

mic is low let see is that better how's

that is either that or or it got to be

your Walmart TV whichever

one is my voice echoing

you know they come in and submit the

Burger

King Burger King

menu they're like we want in so loud

that we can hear your stomach

Grumble

okay cool no Echoes great great so you

got you got to return that TV brother

the Walmart they got you you got to

return that

TV so

um actually I want to do a top down

analysis with y'all real quick uh let me

go

to um the current contract

right let me just do this

first I should probably give youall

levels to set until like next week right

so we all like yeah do it do it

uh

so do you guys see that

we cook that low right

there when I did a top down analysis

with the group yesterday I told them

that I was

anticipating um after this low was taken

I was anticipating this low uh to be

taken out as well this is that uh

Wednesday January 31st low um and

overnight y'all that yall y'all saw that

momentum overnight that was that was

something 360 points down

overnight that was amazing that's why I

said that with with these higher time

frame

moves this is it's not your business as

a day

trader this is not your

business trying to figure out if this

log is taken so does that mean that now

we go back up into no that's not your

business when these higher time frame

lows get taken they take them with Force

yes they they split right through them

like a banana take them with Force what

is your business is after these

people are ran

out you have enough money at that point

to be able to buy back up or trade back

in

so the other day we um did the top down

we talked

about the sng responsible for the break

right so we get that out the

way when we go down hit the top of it

this you know we always anticipate

something like that uh off of this move

even if this is not set to whole there

still is a possibility that price trades

lower y'all y'all see every weekend how

we get all of this news that just throws

us down the other way again so um you

know you don't want to be too much in

haste um you know to have an opinion

that oh now we hit here yeah we're going

to get back up into the previous range

there although it is a possibility I

mean you look we have this High we have

this low right we close below so that

validate dat at the high right we closed

above so that caused the low to be a

protected low This Is Us taking out that

protected low that's what this move is

so when

we bring up the previous range that we

had right

there we know

that the thing we have is this

fractal so the highest point we

anticipate price to get to that's if it

pushes to this fractal is at least right

into the center of the fractal 50% of

the fractal with the possibility of just

flushing up above the fractal and then

taking us back down like that back below

it so when we go back below it that

could give us enough momentum below here

to move us back up above the high that

was put in there to actually trade back

into the previous range trade back into

the 50% of the move so um last

year um well I think it was early this

year I had mentioned that this is

probably just going to end up being in a

Range so what we have here is the bottom

of the range and what we have here is

the top of the

range and this is essentially

the environment that we're going to be

in we accumulate right after taking out

what well we we don't have the data on

this one but after taking out an all

high to the left we accumulate so we

took out that alltime high from 2021 so

we

accumulate and when we

accumulate that creates enough orders

enough momentum for us to either expand

higher or trade lower so we need to

understand that when we get into the

environment that we're accumulating in

we need to trade with an accumulating

mindset I say that in all the videos

that I post on this channel I say that

you know in the mentorship as well um

you know talk about it on Twitter

everywhere you need to trade in an

accumulating mindset somebody asked me

what they what I thought Bitcoin was

doing let's go to bitcoin I had

mentioned that we traded up above this

old high right on the day daily right

the previous all-time high as well

2021 what do we have going on

here the same thing we were expecting on

NQ we have accumulation taking place so

this is the bottom of the range right

and this is the top of the range right

so you prioritize shorts in the top of

the range you prioritize Longs in the

bottom of the range and that's literally

the whole essence of range Trading

so for us to be in a larger range around

here on on uh

um uh uh whatever this pair's name is

enq for us being a larger

range on enq is the same exact

thing we trade from the bottom of the

range to the top of the range to the

bottom of the range to the top of the

range until price does what until it

begins to trade lower and Target lows

right heads back to the origin right or

we end up going back for highs again now

how would we you know essentially Point

those things out um that's let me go

back to the other contract

that's that is BAS based

on what we do within this range

so if you look

at the tops of the range let me just

just take this

there if you look at the tops of the

range you see that anytime we trade it

below and close below we trade it back

to the bottom of the range right same

thing here in the bottom of the range we

trade up close above we head back back

to the top of the range we close above

right we continue to head up

right this provided a close below but

then we flush back up above the high

that's that's fine th those things you

know they occur um and that's why you

got to make sure you take your profit so

we end up getting a mini range within

here but then when we trade back up

again first of all the the closure above

put us back into the top of the range

the closure below put us back into the

bottom of the range and at no point no

point as as we began coming down did we

get a closure back up above to price

higher so we continue to get closures

below right closures below right so in

the event that and this is not just even

you know counting today today could just

you know end in a Range end as a dogee

or something like that remember we

anticipate that it's getting back to

this fractal but in the event

that we

get a closure above let's say this

candle closed like this it's not

currently closed so you don't want to

utilize this you know while it's still

alive in the event that we get a body

closure above like

that then we know

that that's a possibility ility to put

us what we mention up

above this

high so us trading back up above this

High we would nine times out of 10 get a

rejection out of here back into that

previous range below should we end up

closing below a bullish candle so we end

up closing with a body below bullish

candle now that gives us that momentum

to come back down and attack these

lows so it's essentially following the

same thing within the range whether it's

the lows of the range whether it's the

highs of the range it's the same exact

thing so being that we're in a Range a

range has structure on a lower time

frame but the range

itself the range itself is not bound by

structure it's bound by

extremes that's where we talk about the

bottom of the range and the top of the

range so you'll see structure created

and broken so many times within the

range

right many times within the range you

see structure created and

broken but on a lower time frame you'd

see structure leading to those different

areas the the last thing you want to

do is in the center of the Ring

range you're holding a position

here saying that price is going lower

and we end up trading higher or saying

that price is going higher and we end up

trading

lower this the thing you don't want to

do what would you what we understand

with this is that the previous range

that we have according to structure with

that body closure that we just got

is

here right so we know

that the run into this would just be

providing a rejection back down now

could we reject down trade back in again

off of something in here fail there

create an equal high within here to drop

down and now take the lows absolutely

but that would just end up creating

what that would just end

up sorry bringing us down here for what

another move up

again and we' just end up walking

structure down on a higher time frame

right and it doesn't mean that if we

push up above that inside High there we

can push up above there and not close

we get no closure there we trade back

below again look at what this leads into

this this kind of price

action this kind of price action ends up

leading into what later on in the

year if that's the way price began to

move because from this high right here

when we first got here this is

December so from

December into where we currently are in

April we've been in the same

spot yeah slightly higher

than you know where where uh uh the end

of December had us but it's still the

same

area so we need to understand that

instead of trying to pick tops and

bottoms based on the higher time frame

we need to trade with that that

ranged mind

understanding that we're in

accumulation anytime we trade below old

low anytime we trade above old high we

get

accumulation

so that's just it for the higher time

frame

context

um for me

here all I had marked out within here

was this

fractal you guys first saw me

come on actually no I I had removed it

before I came on this fractal that's

below

here so in the event that

price trades below this low sorry not

that

one trades below this low and

consequently below this low

too this is where you end up having a

move back into the previous range so

there's uh 39 minutes left on that let

me actually just look at what else we

got

here

um yeah this is this is

fine go to

15 yeah this is

fine f Bal they was trading back up and

then putting a body below this uh low

right here

431 should end up looking for these

lows and tapping back into this

um 4our fractal

below so yeah that that's why you guys

saw me with this this drawing in here

first you saw the trend line Traders

killing everybody they they be cooking

they got their own system and and they

be cooking y'all because y'all want to

trade every detail in the

market so yeah that that's

essentially um what I have there's a

possibility of another bounce

406 uh but ultimately I want to see us

get below that uh

387 so I figured out I'll go through

that

um top down with y'all um just so you

understand

that we are not in the the environment

to be picking bottoms and tops I see

people talk about

um stocks will never go up in their

lifetime again you know you got all

these macroeconomic people you know who

are like we were right it's

coming it's on the

way it's coming you know like they

they've been waiting for this crash for

for a very long time they call it a melt

up a melt up now now we just creating

names to try to avoid being wrong the

market was supposed to crash but it's

melting up now what it's bullish that's

what you mean you were wrong you were

wrong it's bullish like just let's

let's let's say when we wrong okay we

wrong we wrong you know and when we

right

we glorious feeling when we're right but

when we're wrong we need to admit that

we're wrong it's not a melt up caught

you by surprise you would try to call

the top and you try to call the top and

the top and then the top again and then

the top again and then the top again and

everybody just eating up all your

prophets on the way up you you were

wrong and then when I started hearing

influences you know like in other spaces

um Fitness influences and you know

people who who um do podcast and stuff

like that when I started hearing him

talk about these things it's like oh

yeah oh no this

is you know you get Andrew Tate talking

about a melt up and I'm just like

[Music]

oh oh you know they they just

they that's that's

just not wanting to say that you were

wrong right you can stay wrong for that

long come

on strong and wrong making up different

words to the trying is melting up okay

yeah got you hey my man my man Sam was

in the building what's up baby

profitable losers in the building y'all

that man

if I had your hands i' cut mine off

that's that's that's an amazing brother

right there doing some amazing things uh

in the community uh happy to have you

here

brother uh so you know with with that uh

uh topown that we we just gave consider

that over the next few

weeks consider it over the next few

weeks right consider it over the next

few weeks

and trade based on that stop holding

positions that come back to

you stop holding positions that you

wanted to go further you wanted to run

more and then it took everything it gave

you from

you stop doing

that okay it's it's very important this

Market is not made for

us anybody that's on this live stream I

promise you none of us have enough money

to pick tops and bottoms in this market

this Market hasn't been it's not made

for

us so if we can come in and take money

out of thin air if we can come in and

take money from somebody on the other

side that's losing because their lack of

self-discipline you know the the way the

world works is those who manage risk

take from those who

don't so the same people in this market

all trading together

remember everybody talking about getting

payouts and all that other stuff

somebody lost their fees for you to get

that

payout somebody didn't exercise they

risk on that somebody paid 50 $60,000 in

payouts I mean in in fees in two three

months in order for you to walk away

with with that payout on the other

side so those who manage risk take from

those who do not

and the sooner you understand that

you'll see that you what what needs to

be in your rules of Risk

Management what needs to be in your

rules of Risk Management right is paying

yourself everybody has all these

different rules of how to Trail a runner

and how to do all of this but what about

the rules of paying yourself when is it

enough right you can make money on a

move that you thought it was going

further than that and you were wrong

about that but you still made money with

it you still made

money you still able to protect your

Capital so it's

um you know important for y'all to

uh add that to a part of of risk

management pay yourself or as my man

prop say let them pay you to get

out and it's gonna hit every time let

them pay you to get

out no reason that you stubborn

believing that it got to hit your TP or

come all the way back to your stop

loss I watched some one guy I see these

charts on Twitter all the time there was

this one guy he you know had a position

you know like that on on Euro USD he was

aiming for 4 R you know some something

like

that he's aiming for hold I'm trying to

there we go he's aiming for four

I watch price get all the way up

here

right and see it come all the way back

down

here and his post

was

negative 1

R1 R I'm sorry that that went almost

three

are and within your risk management

approach because you weren't right about

that this small little thing within this

you allow yourself to give back all the

profits and then go right back to your

stop

loss that that's the tax the the tax

they pay they talking

about that's that's not you didn't pay

any

tax you got to write off from your

foolishness

so in your in your your you know risk

management

approach just be sure that you guys are

including

that pay yourself lock something

in this whole thing

everything that we do

here it's about paying

yourself nothing else but paying

yourself we don't come here to sing

Kumbaya we don't come here to laugh and

and and joke and and you know just waste

away with our

time and not monetize it you shouldn't

be on social media if you're not making

money and trading what are you doing

arguing with Joe Biden he even read

those

tweets what are you

doing

yo it's just some crazy stuff you know

so I want y'all to to get a little

better with with um those

techniques want you to get a little

better with that let me look at what's

on the the five second in there no they

they still they still taking this down

y'all

yeah they still taking this down there's

a little bounce out of

this 5sec down candle but they still

taking this down look at this like this

this is this is how want you guys to

frame

it so this is going down like

this like that

right what you need

is a manipulation down

down up looks like they about to run it

we'll see if they take out this High

then more than likely they're going to

go back to this

here uh let me see there right

there but they're running this down in a

channel more than likely you get the

manipulation below and price comes back

up to take out these highs within it

right so the only thing you want to keep

is this up

above when it makes that run back in the

only thing that's worth shorting from is

this up above not any of these highs

within here that's for anybody to trade

down on a second time

frame so

like I said we're going to hit this when

the when the down

candle trades into this

Zone here when it trades into this

depending on how far it

goes that's where a nice little buy stop

to trade back into the

range comes from so Trail these down

candle highs until you get in into this

Zone and then you buy stop

it and we watch price trade back up to

take out some of these highs in here why

because some of these highs in here are

not a part of one minute

structure and this is that that uh

uh there's a 4H hour imbalance here as

well as a 4-Hour fractal

just moving this out the

way oh

SO trading is easy we

just make it difficult uh weekly close

do for OB think I do not speak the

language at

all I don't I don't know what you would

you um

do we have an interpreter here hold let

me see if I can find

one do we get do we got an interpreter

y'all we got we need somebody to speak

cby I going to try

[Music]

to

yeah we get CBA in

here do

weekly close

4 h

o yeah

I you you gonna have to you got to wait

till somebody in the

chat

uh in chat helps me out with that one

because

I I want to serve you the best that I

can you know but there's a language

barrier there

it's going to be difficult so so look

guys

look we have that lower time we're

talking about lower time frame swings

right we have that one there we have

another one there we have another one

there we have another one there we have

another one there so we have

these lower time frame

Swings with

these higher time

frame lows and highs right there right

another low here putting another high

right trade below it give us a body so

we're looking for another higher time

frame uh um

pullback as a third um high in order so

what still bring us back

below so we're still

anticipating that pric is looking to

trade lower than where we currently are

we just don't want to be shorting at the

time that price is pulling

back we want to make sure that we're you

know staying on the side of when price

is going to do what there there's people

there people that what they do is they

go short here and price pulls up 84

points on them they go short here and

price pulls up 84 points on them or 80

points on them so you just want to make

sure that you're not

um shorting at certain lows that prices

getting ready to pull back you know

within

that so that's why I have us now we the

50% of the uh the fractal

there we more than likely

uh I'm thinking we deliver a one to one

on it

but we'll just

wait oh you supposed to be vortexing

right now

Hi D when is the back next back to

membership I don't I don't I'm not sure

I don't know I'm not

sure

um the the one that I'm working on now

it's a tougher group

um you know I'm trying to make sure that

they uh

uh you know sort of get what they need

to so when the next group comes in there

are other people there that's able to um

give them them a

hand on uh uh you know what's needed I

mean you got to think about it I'm one

person like you even look at Sam's group

you know profitable losers group I'm

more than sure that you know as many

people as in his group he's not able to

really answer the question that everyone

has not able to serve everybody not able

to you know do certain things you know

that that he wants to with every single

individual because it's just a lot of

people and it's one person you know um

Dave are you still looking for people to

hire yes yes I am um yes I'm going to

put that application out

soon yes

uh there's people in the class who lie

about watching the free playlist I mean

I I think that's everywhere you know

like I remember one guy um coming to me

and telling me that profitable loser

strategy doesn't work and I was like

well did you back test it and he goes

well that's just

icts and dog like first of all

we don't allow pets in here there's no

pet

policy so the the end

dog the the you know the hogw whatever

all all the animals you want to talk

about we we don't allow that in here but

what you have to do is that you have

to back test no matter what it is that

somebody tells you you have to back test

it

period you have to back test it know if

ands or butt you have to back test it

it's not possible to you know be able to

get any of this knowledge that we have

transferred to you so you could apply in

the proper context if you have not back

tested it there's no

way so you got to make sure that you

back test period

no matter who you're learning from

you're never going to learn one thing

that's going to be the holy grail for

you so let me move this

here

um that Spike up that I'm looking for at

least is going to go above

this uh 407

there so what you want to see is

just that first candle that closes up

above and leaves that

imbalance behind like

that yeah leaves that imbalance behind

so we're at what is it we hit 10:30 yet

nope 10:30 is the next

candle so you want to see a bullish

candle

run take out a previous candle's High

close

but then you want to see some

imbalances um start to form so

this it could be one of those highs

there that we should be looking to push

if you can get a body closure above here

the next candle opens Taps into it and

then runs higher and covers this entire

imbalance and I'm think of 405 is where

it's looking

for right now we traded directly through

the fractal that's fine um we didn't get

a closure until we got below the low of

the fractal see this here pushing up

like that you want to see a run back up

to this High here at

405 and again you're not shorting out of

any of this stuff here because this is

all um not a part of structure

so nice yep yep that that's

it that's what we're looking

for hey BR you enjoy you

enjoy Dave can you show a video on how

to back this the last live stream I did

nice yeah go to go to the last live

stream I um I explained how to back

test but the truth is you should just be

back testing the concepts you you've

learned back test them each session

whatever session you're going to trade

from back test it back test the concept

that you're using

so like I said it should be trading up

above this High

here um with this little tiny fractal

that if we do pull back before it we

could sit

on well there goes a high

now would you more than likely see us do

is take this low right here it happens

that it's imbalance and we know the

first

imbalance puts in another high so you

want to see this close leave that

imbalance open tap back into this

imbalance maybe more or less nearest to

the fractal and then I have another

pushup

got an entry at 17344

beautiful Z in nearest to the fractal

it gets back into this Wick here you

just want to be sure that we don't fail

in here if we end up failing in here

that ends up being a double top in there

that could bring us below this fractal

and then back into that

range so there's

that IM balance top

you know it's funny that this is how

people want to watch

price you know with like all of

this you know uh

uh silence and stuff and I'm just like

you know I get it you you might need to

concentrate you know while you're

trading or while you're pushing a button

and all of that but I've pushed a button

so

much I've watched price so much I've you

know

just engag with it way more than than

you know I've play video games and and

that I've studied other things i' I've

done

so much as it relates to price that I

can be distracted by things I can read

the chat while I'm trading and looking

at Price calling it and listening to

music and checking notification real

quick all of these different things I

can

do because I've done this part of it so

much that's where back testing comes in

some people believe that that you know

if if you uh

uh if you don't back test you could

still make it you could still you need

the real experience you know all of that

other St you need the real experience

none of that is true back testing gives

you the real experience guess what that

same area that you're going through in

back testing somebody got

cooked somebody got

smoked in that same area that you're

back there looking at somebody somebody

got hog washed in this

drop from this high all the way down to

here somebody got smoked thinking

that they were in that move to be the

first people going

up has this happened before yes plenty

of

times plenty of

times so you see what I said so if we

get caught in this Wick we can trade

back into this Wick if we end up getting

stuck in this Wick it's going to come

for the low of the this fractal right

here so you see the low of the fractal

taken

right nice little bounce off of it but

the low of the fractal

taken

now we're

in this down move

here more than likely what you want to

see is let's take the low of that candle

that just closed

tap into this Zone and pop back the

other

way and this is why I talk about if

there's two imbalances after a high is

taken you don't want to consider the

first one you want to consider the next

the the second one nearest to the snd so

this imbalance here you know did give a

nice little pop off of it you know nice

little uh 18-point move off of it um but

I don't trade IM balances anymore I only

trade

utilizing um uh structure zones so what

this is if you guys um watch that video

on Candlestick structure what this is is

that's the high that's the low put in we

traded up Above This Is Us trading back

into that Candlestick structure

flip so that's the only reason why I

would be looking for that low to get

taken out and us going back into this

Z and if we

can get that down candle that pushes in

there you might end up being able

to buy stop back into

sorry back into the

wick up

there so that moves further down into

it I don't know how youall like this

with no

music I figured I'd come out and try

this

but this is just

agonizing guess some people ain't there

yet we they able to just hear noises why

they why they

trading so that's what a successful

candles stick structure flip looks

like we take out that high we trade back

into The Zone and we push back I don't

think we quite delivered the one to one

as of yet um but you see that move right

into the 50% of it and we get that

little push out heading back here the

people who buy stop if we don't trade up

above this down candle High then you're

safe should we end up taking this low

then you know that's something that you

were able to escape without having to

utilize you could move that by stop down

to here

now down to this

high and for me pretty much the the way

that I um

approach prices uh on sweeps

so if they left a wick behind here and

then trade it back below I would be a

part of the move that goes below here

and goes back up for the wick

there so this is not um uh this is an

entry that a lot of people may take

that's fine this is just not one that um

I particular ly uh utilize I pretty much

wait for the sweep and then uh trade

higher but there's the oneto one

delivery uh coming into play bam right

there you

see now the people who got activated in

their buy stop

here this

is smaller Candlestick structure flip

within

here with with this low into this High

then we shift below then we trade out so

now we're back into there for that

confirmation one I don't do confirmation

entries in

downtrends because I'm expecting often

times a sweep of that but being that

this could just

be equal low here that runs back for

this High and the high of that zone too

that's the only reason why I would even

be you know marking something out like

this but that's the entries I choose to

take versus the the um group of entries

that I teach so you see why I talk about

the one: one being something that you

know you should consider because look at

what happens right after the one: one we

deliver the one to one right and then

you see a move back into the range of it

so if you traded from here to the one to

one and you were able to cut on that I

know a lot of people a lot of people are

like oh these are small moves no they're

not this is this is almost 15 points

that you get in a push coming out of

there like

that almost 15 points when when they

Mentor I says five handles for Life he's

talking about Five Points

so these moves are not small you can pay

yourself with things like this look this

is that that uh uh Candlestick structure

move in

here that I mentioned see it pushing

back out like that

again now why am I looking on this side

and why am I not talking

about the Zone that's here why am I not

talking about that

the one to the left why am we not

talking about finding a short way to go

back

below

because what occurred here and how I

mentioned that you want to see those

imbalances forming as we're pushing up

right so it trades back to the origin of

that move and that's the origin of this

push coming out so if there's anything

in there again

for for price to you know move us higher

it would come out of this point of

Interest here and as we mentioned we

could see us go back up to

what that Wick that's above there and

what that would show us

is that there's a low there and there's

a low there and we look to Target that

high and potentially the high of the

Zone because that zone when we went back

up and tapped into it it didn't give us

a new low so that ends up rendering this

Zone within here a weak Zone well it

could it could be you know that that

zone there or potentially this uh up

move here as well so you you might get

another rejection you know somewhere

around here but it could end up looking

for the high of that now how many

entries can I find

within something like

this how many Ines can I

find taking trades off that the first

buy stop that pushed up there right the

second buy stop on the confirmation that

moved up there right the little tap into

the imbalance take a couple points off

of it saw it you know uh uh fail there

and then take the low of the fractal

does not mean we're going lower

does not mean we're going

lower we know we returned to the origin

of that move up now I don't know what's

to the left I don't know if we're

bouncing out something to the left then

the you know there could be some

imbalance there there could be some 4H

hour down candle I don't know I don't

know what's

there but it's based on what you see

price doing now what's the first thing

that I did

when we began to

talk you guys heard me count the swings

right so by the fifth swing I was done

looking for continuations and now was

looking to be on the long side the six

swing we traded up above it no over here

we traded up above it right and then we

came back below it that doesn't

mean that you're wrong

that just means that there's a

possibility that you're early but guess

what the algorithm will still do exactly

what it is scripted to

do whether you were early or

not it would still do

that so you may have people wanting

lower

tell you take out the high of that zone

right particularly this one two I was

seeing at first this this uh the high of

this but like I mentioned there could be

another rejection here before taking

it

so trading literally is about what

what's the first thing that I

noted oh well well 10 10:30 is the next

candle

10 10:30 all right next count is going

to be

10:30 youall hear how the first part of

the trading plan was

created no trades before

10:30 looking at all that's occurring

even if we don't start trading before

10:30 we begin to look at what has

occurred prior to

that then we saw that equal low there we

go okay yeah these are not areas to

Short from here because we're going to

end up going up above this high so that

means you rule out any small fractal

you're choosing inside of there any

small snd you have on the lower time

frame there you're ruling that out so

you don't get cooked by those little

losses we said there' be another

rejection inside of here

right all of these things can be

followed

can be followed can be

predicted the problem is a lot of the

times we're zoomed in like

this we see a large candle come down oh

my goodness oh it's happening Black Swan

is is H is happening y oh oh my is it's

this

happening is is getting ready to take

place y'all I'm telling

you you better hold on to your wigs I'm

tell

this why are we so zoomed in that

close not understanding where these

different things are coming

from where they taking

place and we just follow price that's it

so our money is not in chasing price

higher our money is in getting a

pullback into

continuation based on whatever side it

is that we're on

right so this would end up being this

drop into

here would end up being the first swing

heading

up so why would we be shorting

after only

one wouldn't we be looking for a

pullback into a

move back in

again and that's when you begin to

question why

are we so zoomed into price that any

little candle that forms any any down

candle any up candle that forms we

instantly change our

idea of what we're expecting price to

do what did the plan

say what did the plan say

and the same plan that's on this side

right is the same plan on this side is

it

not so we talked about here the first

imbalance potentially putting in a new

high but if we get stuck in this fror if

we get stuck in that Wick it'll take out

this low right so here's the first

imbalance again did it put in a new high

and anybody running short because they

see a down candle form and they want to

short a pullback why are you on that

side I saw Justin wh say something

earlier today he said that it's the

little losses and I was telling my group

this yesterday so it was funny seeing

that he says the little losses this

chipping away

from the amount you have to

risk there those little tiny unnecessary

losses that's chipping away from

that and yes that's 100% the issue for

people those little

losses you're not a bad Trader you need

better discipline

you know bad

trading you need to be better at

discipline discipline with what your

plan what is your plan according to what

you've learned in back testing according

to it it goes against the tested data

no I asked some people in the group this

week we'll work on it next week but I

ask some people in the group this week I

said what is your plan to get

in what's your trade plan the the very

fourth one the fourth part of your plan

should be

execution and people are telling me my

Concepts also so when we're in a Range

then I got to make sure that you know at

the top of the range that's the only

place that I'm looking for Longs and I'm

not going to hold everything anything in

the middle of the range and then how is

that a plan to get in

how's that BL to find an

entury I told people they need structure

they need narrative then they need their

zones and then they need their their

entry

right I ask somebody what their plan is

they say structure narrative zones and

what so there's there's nothing that

that you can literally spell out to a

12-year-old for them to look at it and

then take an entry somewhere around the

completion of that

plan all the boxes being checked in that

plan you don't have a

plan you cannot get into an entry

without a plan you cannot get into an

entry without a plan you cannot get into

an entry without a plan you cannot get

into an entry without a plan you cannot

get into an entry without a plan a plan

is a plan is not I think it's going to

reject

here you know what's going to be

rejected you're pay

out that's what's going to be

rejected I think it's gonna go down from

here because we still have more you

think

what Market looks at you

like you think you Professor X you you

can move things with your

mind

so it's important to understand that I'm

sure by the time I got down here

everybody's like why is he looking to to

why is he looking to the long side why

is he looking to go long

now and what did I say I said before we

even got

there I said there are people who are

ready to go short and they get pulled

back by 80 something points the other

way because they're ready to go short so

I said what I'm looking for is for a

third higher time frame pullback because

of these lows that are here right

looking for that right closure there so

we get down here it doesn't matter when

I I you know begin to see what I'm

looking for either way I know I'm only

looking for one thing this the move back

into there because the minute I try to

go short from something inside of here

to go down guess what I'm being drawn up

in that higher time frame

pullback and where did that higher time

frame buback go 80 something points the

other

way knowing when to when not

to not saying that people can't find

shorts to continue you

down should that be what price gives

you I don't know if you talked about

this trade I took a short at 10:31

because I focused on structuring had a

one minute Zone 5c flip um because the

higher the Zone got taken out that's

fine you can short or long wherever you

want you just have to know how long you

can hold on to that entry

that's a

okay you took a short that's fine other

people took

along but you have to know how long you

can hold

that and 1 minute 5 second I hope that

you're profitable because if you're not

profitable you should not be on the

5-second time frame

you guys don't have videos of me

teaching you the

5sec none of the accounts that I've I've

I've been running up at all none of the

accounts I've been trading would I've

been trading the 5-second time frame so

for people to not be successful with the

one minute and have this lust for

wanting to be on the 5sec

no become good with the one minute first

and then move down to the lower time

frame anything else is

backwards so you see what we mentioned

here looking for the

pullback down into here

right for what the possibility

of

a move back up into there maybe what is

this they get this fractal yet no not

yet I'm thinking just a little a little

bit lower and then little push off of it

somewhere down

here but you have to know what you're

looking

for

so no the uh Q on Keys No I did not

trade with the Apex payout I did not

trade the 5-second time frame at all I

did not trade the second time frame at

all I was not on the seconds time frame

at

all you do not need the seconds time

frame you need to know where you're

trading from and you need to trust what

you're executing on

that's

it there's nothing else to it and and

the average trade on that was like 10

points this whole this whole move up

here this whole move up here was 80

something

points now couldn't I find an entry to

give me half of that each trade I took

yes yes yes that's possible

yes but what's the sense of

managing a trade to go remember I said

that that I I had a belief that it was

going up above this high

right which that belief is not not is

still still have that belief but imagine

being in an entry somewhere around

here and

I believe that we're going to this High

here

right and I'm let let's say I'm here in

the

entry and now I'm in draw down I'm in

profit now I'm back into draw down then

I'm back into profit and then I'm back

into draw down and then I'm back into

all of this time that's gone by just to

get a TP here

it would be crazy of

me

when it came this

close but because I needed to be right

about seven more points is back to entry

for me

again and how many other entries could I

have found inside of

here how many other moves could I have

taken

in there and and been right

about and paid

myself that same

amount just from knowing where to begin

scalping where to begin whether it's

with the trend counter Trend doesn't

matter which

one I just know what what is occurring

here easy to spot

top of the

range bottom of the range is

accumulation knowing where to get in

knowing when to knowing when not

to I always get lost in overanalyzing

that's because you too zoomed in

there's the problem you two zoomed

in is the stream going to stay public

afterwards yes it

is yeah you you two zoomed

in 100% that's your

issue do zoom in

likewise that's a lot of people's

issue you think

that you need to

be

facing the candles like this and you'd

be interpreting every little thing

inside of

here when there are things

that have already occurred

right there are things that already

occurred that'll give us the

understanding of of what's potentially

getting ready to occur next and we would

just wait on

that wait on that right so what's a

simple example of

that this high right here whatever this

is taing into below more than likely it

often looks to go back and take out that

previous high right

there and that'll run right back to this

fractal with the possibility of taking

out the high of the fractal because

of this Zone above here not entirely

being

mitigated so we we have that we we have

that that little

understanding of that and if if that's

what we believe is going to occur if

we're on the lower second if we're on

the the the lower time frame we're on

the second time frame and we see our uh

uh seconds uh confirmation within here

then we trade

that if we're willing to take whatever

is here to the left and utilize trading

off of that then we trade

that but regardless of what it is we

have to be willing to accept what the

loss behind that that area we're

choosing to trade from except that this

is our uh um um take profit or or this

is what we're looking for to looking to

occur and when this happens we need to

know where we are exiting not trying to

a lot of people ask me this question how

do you

manage um how do you manage your stop

losses

like how do you

Trail your stop losses I Trail my stop-

losses by taking

profit that's how I try my stop

losses I try my stop losses by taking

profit

so

again pay yourself

um guys you recommend college and trade

or just trade you should do college

defin if you're in college do college

definitely

100% because if trading doesn't work out

for you you have something to fall back

on so College

100% it teaches you how to complete

something it teaches you how to finish

something College taught me a lot was it

needed for me

no because I don't currently use the

degree but it taught me how to learn

properly that's what it did it taught me

how to learn

properly so if if

that's you know something that you still

struggle with with learning then then

you know you need to learn and

successfully complete something

you learn and successfully complete

something I left College last year I

mean hey it's not for everybody you

know uh this DRS are distracting your

mouth is distracting uh what was your

degree in uh

psychology uh been taking 10 points for

this Market beautiful

um that's too far away please zoom in

put your glasses on when the mentorship

reopen I'm not too sure

yet um I Heard somewhere you recommend a

profitable loser everywhere I recommend

the profitable

loser

uh let me see how do you know it is

accumulation because I am he the master

back tester

um let me

see how not to get lost I told you that

zoom out make sure you zoom out

uh let me

see how do proper plan looks like um you

got to find it in back

testing cover the kids

is Target

filled

um always confused with counter swing

since as count seven well you got to

know that they're from different time

frames so that's your problem you're not

counting um

from one specific time

frame this feels like House of no music

that is true but you know this is

something that people need to

see um that I'm saying this

beforehand and we're watching it do it

and then we're seeing the completion of

it and I'm giving all the wise for it

and I'm telling people how they

should look to set their entries up and

where they should look to take profit

and you know all of those different

things I'm I'm teaching it in real time

it's not just going over something in

past price action oh I want to see a low

get taken hey nobody care about that I

don't have enough money for a high and

low to be taken I want to show you

what's happening now and here's why I

believe it and here's what I think it's

going to happen and here's because

because I the thing is going to happen

not because I'm trading what I think

it's because I've tested and verified

this over and over and over and over and

over and over and over and over and over

and over and over and over and over and

over I've watched this more than you've

watched TV I've watched this more than

you play video games so I know beyond

the shadow of a doubt whatever it is

that I see occurring whatever it is that

I believe is occurring I know that I'm

going to trust that over trusting you

us3 is about to dump and then you watch

it pump 100 points into your

nostrils because what

you thinking that something is going to

happen versus you verifying in price

that this is something that occurs

right so

I I told yall y you gota you gotta

accept you got to accept the law you got

to accept what what it is you're you're

wagering you got to accept the fact that

this this is your target you got to

accept the fact that this is how you

you're anticipating your setup to

occur if you have not verified these

things in back testing you can never

trust them in forward

testing some of y'all just want a

forward test and not back test okay

that's

fine somebody told me I was a white

supremacist because I told them they

need to back test the question they

asked

me now back testing is a racial slur

crazy

right

so you know you you need to back test

more than you forward test back testing

is more important than forward

testing back testing is more important

than forward testing you're not going to

hear a lot of people tell you

that but you're also not going to hear a

lot of people say the things I say every

day is a trading day every day is a

profitable day it's a blessing be on the

right side of the market you're not

going to hear people talking like

that you're not going to hear people you

know something happened overnight

everybody's like oh trade demo today

because the price action is going to be

don't you dare because we we it's so

much uncertainty Israel Obama Iran and

y'all so addicted to trading it's Friday

you should go and and and you should you

should be studying you should not want

to have to just push the button all the

time that's an addiction you and they

projecting all of that on

you when it's the same stuff occurring

each and every day how dare you say it's

an algorithm and you act like it's it's

going to do something

different scriptures do one thing and

only one

thing and when you see that thing you

know you saw him back testing time and

time and time again

that's where your profitability

is

right that's where your profitability

is what do you think of today's

quarterly Theory um

I wish him a quadrennial year I don't

know anything about

that instead of saying Happy New Year to

people now I'm say happy quadral

year hopefully I'm right I don't know

anything about

that when does the one to one fail why

you don't want to back to us how about

you go and back to us and see when it

fails you just going to ask questions

all the time AP trades what's up baby

um I'm telling them

back

test oh no that that's that's not the AP

trades we talking about hold up that's

that's a fool my

bad wrong wrong wrong AP trades look at

this look at

this oh is that the right AP trades I

don't I don't know I'm

I'm very difficult decision should we

chat should we block him or should we

which what should we do chat

should should we block him chat or or

she that's not AP trades that's PA

trades that's his

cousin trying to see with the chat

trying to give me to do let me let me

put up a let me put up a uh a poll real

quick hold on oh

I hit the wrong button sorry

ap3 never mind no poll anymore

so this this is this is what you know I

I want you guys to to

consider remember what I

said I said that when we begin that

accumulation I started off in this in

this

video talking about it you guys go back

into the video you hear me

discussing I started off

saying how to trade accumulation now

accumulation what we're discussing is

what happens from higher time frame to

lower time frame

right that's what we're talking about

it's not something that's restrictive to

this one time

frame accumulation is the same kind of

accumulation on all time frames not just

to this one time frame so what we talked

about here

is the accumulation above right here

right so what we should be expecting or

anticipating

is when we open up it let's say let's

say we leave this Wick here when we open

up we should be looking for price to

trade at least back to this fractal

right or slightly up above it and then

shift back into the range

for

Monday if it closes like

this we should be anticipating that

based on the area that we're tapping

into to the left

right and we know that we just took a a

low

right and we know all Concepts work

right so here we have the support and

resistance this is prior support turn

resistance so we would be looking for

the retest of this previous support turn

resistance right so that's one thing

two we should be looking at Price taking

a low and rebalancing to an fvg right

this ICT concept whatever we should be

looking at dtfa of course you know with

the the zones that we in we anticipating

price to trade you know out of this snd

response but at least above the previous

candles

this is a daily time frame that we're

we're now you know forecasting some of

this

stuff we know that this is a four candle

drop based on a daily right so if this

is a four candle drop based on a

daily then what we're looking for is the

people that go long from here we know

there's a possibility that price takes

them out first and then trades in the

other way to take the high out that was

put in so whether that high goes above

the previous candle High whether it runs

into the fractor just just up above what

we're anticipating for the day right or

or maybe not even the day let's say the

day Clos as a doy the following day can

run to that

high and then you got people going oh

the high of the week putting on Tuesday

and then the L you know all of those

different things that are in

there which which they all you know sort

of work

out uh uh the same

way but

but we would essentially be considering

that because what we also know that we

at the bottom of a

range we know Long's in the bottom of

the range

right so it means Monday into Tuesday

you could have that

run going back into the range going back

to retest to whatever it is going back

to rebalance going whatever it is it's

doing

you go to the weekly time frame you know

the weekly time frame the weekly candle

could open put in a wick here and then

what the that's for the the uh the P3

Bros then what put in a body like

that and then have a

wick just below it like that

next candle TS back into the wick follow

candle moves up like that above the

previous week's high

now tons of stuff you could anticipate

you can you can think

of you see

happening but some people just have no

real material materialization of of

getting into the trade getting into the

move so

remember what I said I said that we

often get the sweep of that low right

and when we get the sweep of that low

what you tend to see is

that when price leaves a little Wick

behind

here often times what we're anticipating

is for price to run back to it and

potentially take the high of it right so

there's a a a ton of

reasons

why you know we can be getting into

little entries to

scalp and little areas that we we you

know are Nimble on in terms of taking

profit

and it's just that it has to be a part

of our

plan it must be a part of our plan must

number one it must be a part of our

plan

so there goes my low

there previous candle's high is

here you the bullish close above could

run right into that Wick right there

right and with that you have to know

beyond a shadow of a doubt that you've

seen

it in order to take part in it

in order to trade it like you know you

you

know that St price hit there there a

possibility of giving you a heat heat a

TP look at that that's a dyslexia

possibility of giving you TP

there at at this this high but most

importantly it could just be looking to

run back

into that zone there

right there so we got a

sweep on the lower time frame

here and if we can get up above this and

close then we can run to that high there

and it's as simple as

that so what is it it do if it gets into

here you know there's a possibility of

rejecting back

into whatever Zone it would have created

below and if that's enough to take price

higher Above This Wick that's what it

does if it's not then it struggles in

there and then puts in another

low but you have to know how it looks

from lower time frame to high higher

time frame so what do we have on a lower

time frame here what we have is these

swings right we have

one we have two we have three we have

four we have

five so we have five swings that are

currently on this lower time frame

heading down so the same thing that we

mentioned here moving down into here and

then you begin to see price move

sideways here and you begin to see price

move back up above there the same exact

thing

here so here would essentially be

waiting to capitalize on that moment of

running back into the previous

range and there's several techniques

that I've shared in the dis I mean in

the Discord on YouTube the several

techniques that I've shared on how

to get into an entry specifically video

7 and video 8 but y'all don't like to

read y'all don't like to watch y'all

don't like to write but y'all expect to

learn it

just it it is beyond me you don't want

to read you don't want to write you

don't want to watch but you think you're

going to

learn that's why I told a young man to

ask about college go

to

college it will teach you how to

learn go to

college so there's

the six swing

there and you see

it wicking up

six swing there you could look for it to

move back above these highs and I

still have us looking to get back into

this wake

here

so you have to learn how to

learn you cannot think that you could

sit there and watch a 27 minute video

and all of a sudden you're

profitable because you still got to

watch it in real time and guess what

those videos they're in real

time they're in real time go and look at

somebody's back tested video and then go

and try to replicate it I promise you

you're still not going to be

profitable you are still not going to be

profitable still not going to be

profitable oh you stole so and so you

just doing the Quasi Moto so you knew

about the Quasi Moto all these years and

you still struggling with profitability

what's up with

that I wasn't I wasn't profitable off of

the Quasi motor I was profitable off of

trend lines what's up with

that what's up with that you KN you knew

all this time about that what's up with

that

you know all of these

strategies you know who stole what but

you can't use it

yourself oh that's right you you just

the the trading encyclopedia

okay you just your trading

encyclopedia and everybody else that

comes around what do they want to

do they want to reinvent the wheel but

they don't know how to

drive going reinvent the wheel

yet you don't know how to

drive something is up with

that reinvent the

wheel don't know how to

drive so that's why I don't listen to

people who who say other things about

other strategies and oh well this is

going to do that because if you look at

this and then pair it with the

fundamentals with that and then do that

and then that's not going to change my

idea of what I believe price is doing

what I believe price is going to

do that is not going to change my I

could tell you that

much that is not going to change my

idea of what I believe price is going to

do because what I've seen in back

testing is

enough them trend lines work and people

still giving Tor shape that's because

people are ignorant people think that

just because they have strategies that

could lower their

risk to far less of a risk than a trend

line can or a triangle can or a channel

can or whatever it is or or the support

and resistance can they think that

because they have these strategies that

could lower their risk a lot more they

look down on everybody

else and it's funny

because now that the ICT Community is

seeing a lot of this

you know stuff that we're doing take you

know take on a lot of popularity and

stuff they're upset that we always

mention and troll their

strategies but if you listen to what

they do to other people it is a terrible

thing most of it not all of it because

there's other people who you know act

like strategy leaders too but most of it

comes from that

Community most of it comes from the ACT

community unfor

most of

it so for us we

we you know make certain to let people

know every strategy can

work it's

you that doesn't work every strategy out

there can

work it's you it's you it's you

and and we'll show alongside this is

what I love that stoic does we'll show

alongside how all of these

things

work we'll show you channels we'll show

you trend lines we'll show you you know

all of that other good stuff we we show

you all

that trust and believe we're going to

show it to

you we'll show you every bit of

it and show you how you you can put it

all together but you got to start with

one

thing you got start with one

thing and you work your way

out but if you're not good at one thing

you're not going to be good at anything

that's why we prioritize

structure

right so guys look why why am I not

shorting through this

why am I looking to go short in

that well based on what was said

already what we were

anticipating

right was for price to move back into

the other

end to a particular

area after something occurred to the

left

that's what we were

anticipating so at any

point we saw the pop run up above

that that uh um those highs in

there we show us run right to that line

and what we we stopped yeah we

anticipated price to take take out the

high of

it

but it's not our job to be 100% right

about what price is

doing it's our job to understand what

price is doing and find a way to get

involved find a way to get

involved so what we have

here is the same thing we met mentioned

over here

right I move up until I move down we

trade higher we go back there and then

we had a little push off of there right

and then the same thing happened inside

of here

right this move up we trade down we push

higher we go back here we trade higher

right

go down go up BR down trade higher go

back into this move and then we trade

higher right same thing

happening right same thing

happening

over and over again and all it is is up

to us to

find an opportune

time to be able to end enter into the

market enter into the market

right and take something off the table

take something out of

there take a little profit off

of table rather than being right about

whether a weekly draw is going to happen

rather than being right about whether a

daily whatever is going to

happen just a couple minutes a day

couple minutes a

day and there will be times that we are

wrong that's

fine but if we continue to execute based

on what our plan tells us to

do then

Viola we in there like

swimwear what do you about the new

Futures I don't know nothing about prop

firms don't ask me anything about prop

firms um the good old question are you

trying to be right 100% of the time are

you trying to make money and I ask that

question all the time because it's a

question that's

true you want to be right or you want to

make money which

one which

one which one matters more you want to

be right you want to make money

the question is

simple and you're greed

is you know something that

determines the outcome of

that say I've been a longtime follower

of I I was terrified by yesterday's I

breing so I I watched it a little bit he

was explaining some things you know on

on some other pairs like da and and he

was also teaching yesterday I was

teaching too you know I was teaching

about something entirely different of

course but I was teaching yesterday as

well and maybe it's in an environment

where it's best for him to

teach you know there there are some

environments that I really don't like to

trade in in in super trending

environments I'll take a step

out I honor my experience and take a

step out

in in trending

environments maybe in more or less

ranged environments he he wants to take

a step

back I can understand

that and would would prefer to to uh uh

teach so you know with that it it's just

whatever the strong suit is of of the

Traer itself

what will you do if trading won't be

allowed anymore um trading is how the

whole world is

ran like you got to remember these these

um these things that we're looking at

like we have um you know oil over here

we have gold here you we have wheat we

have rice got y'all have y'all seen

Rice have have

y'all sto over here talking about I was

I was sharing rice proper Ganda with

y'all no have y'all seen

rice listen I was buying up some R

that's why I got this area here I was

buying up some rice in in that area

there buying up some

rice because what you see is is I was

watching for rice to go higher up above

this

high that high right there 2023

high and we have R dro a little lower I

was a little afraid you know I I was

going Target

filled I was I was going to get out of

my my

trade right here I start selling rights

on eBay but nothing you know uh

um we we held the zone you see it 50% of

the Zone we held it and look at how rice

is right back up here again we have

plenty of videos on YouTube and

following rice

so Ry has a possibility of of getting

back up to that that 2020 high and I

mean that's going to be

expensive so I enter my position here in

my

garage quite a bit of bags of rice in

here into my position here

and do you see that

we're back up to here again I told you

guys start buying up some of these

things these these uh uh you know things

that that do not expire you know as fast

as fruit or find ways to preserve them

or or whatever it

is find ways to preserve

them because when prices get higher

you're not caught

in you

know now needing to pay a lot more for

something that two weeks ago you paid a

lot less

for two weeks ago you paid a lot less

for

it we actually might be looking for that

48 up there on enq um two weeks ago you

paid a lot less for it but look at that

it had this move down back in here hit

the 50% of the Zone there my stop loss

was right behind here because then I've

been in and draw down because I was

buying from down

here and look at that move

higher that's going to cost

somebody but I know I got enough rice

for got enough right for them to take

that that high there and then drop back

into the Zone there and now you know

prices cool down again now we can add

into our

position before possibility of it

spiking up

again well maybe when it take that you

drop right back into the 50% of the Zone

here so may we get back to the

entry I'm going to have another pump off

of it but if it's a strong Trend what

you see is price pop out of here and

continue higher you won't see it get

back to the

50% is a strong trend

so long as we get a double top somewhere

in here then that's where we could run

that low that we put in after this high

is taken and then potentially look to

Target this low too hopefully you know

it's it don't go down that way where

price runs higher because it's going to

hurt a lot of

people but these charts are not just for

taking little small entries off and

taking little trades off

of oh yes I want it my TP hit no this is

for planning your

life you've access to this data to plan

your

life there 48 look look like we still

going above to that 48

right so let me let me put an alert

there the

48 you been putting alarm there

it let us know when it gets

there

because somebody went

short gold tapped into the previous

day's high after taking the

low um

gold oh yeah gold had that extension

overnight that was a news from Iran and

Israel Israel had

um bombed Iran same thing with this here

too uh oil oil had that same push

overnight as

well I was talking to my kid and I was

teaching them how

to spot some of this stuff and trade it

and I said listen this is oil like oil

real time yeah it's oil you can trade

oil so he like how you know when it's

going to go up and down

well here's the

thing I don't want to brag but but then

I realized I was talking to my kids so I

was like hold on let me let me let me

take you take you in I say you see this

move going up into this move going down

that area that it leaves behind as a

Zone like that open space yeah there a

zone are there any zones down there I

said yeah there's some zones down there

too but what we focusing on is this when

we get there you know when to short to

take price down when we get there you

know when the long to take price up and

all it depends on is how much you think

is enough when you do take these entries

but you got to know where to get in when

to get it so this oil right before

stream I had marked this up I was like

go right there and then you going to see

it move away from

there i' been confident talking to my

kid I'm like Hey listen you think it's

going to go down up let's let's make a

bet let's make a

bet you know them cookies you bought

you the organic chocolate chip cookies

let's make a bet about

it I'm fan competition ain't that

unfair

competition hey look at that yo price

price just they they just don't want me

to

win so let me move them and take profit

up they just don't want me to

win so yeah is it's

um but you still trade those news with

your rules I don't know what you talking

about um you shouldn't trade any news at

all that's what I personally

think no

news yes I was I was hustling the kid I

knew I had the upper hand I knew I had

the upper

hand and every time I eat those cookies

all you hear is nothing but complaints I

don't even eat a lot of them I just eat

like one or two it's called Dad tax but

you know they they

don't they don't understand that you got

to pay taxes in

life they learn

soon that's exactly what they call me

Cookie Monster you've been

listening bab you don't have enough

rights to put in a new H listen soon

enough I am going to have have enough RS

stoic with this

this with this orange juice he's been

sharing orange juice propaganda for the

last few

weeks when is orange

juice you can get your vitamin C other

ways when you hungry juice don't

matter you want that food to fill up the

belly

right I didn't say fill it out I said

fill it up you want food to fill up the

belly you want food

to fill it up right somebody said we

need a music break so hold on y'all when

all right all right let's let's bring it

in let's bring it in your Lumi just

threw us for a loop let's let's bring it

in just do us for a loop I'm I'm I'm

sorry y'all I'm trying to be a little

more professional these days but they

just come on in and

and they

just I don't know they you know what you

know what I think it is they they

probably some felons out there they they

on house

arrest so they ain't got nothing better

to do

da da

da I learned how to measure before I

knew what was I sing sleep

do treat sadness a smile you can't have

what's next till you hang with it for a

while this is house

arrest come we your Sunday

Best this is house arrest

[Music]

I Lear me I knew was I you sleep do you

like

my

[Music]

sadile come to we your Sunday

F this is how

this

[Music]

is

this come to wear your Sunday

F this

[Music]

house all right let me bring it in right

let me bring it in I'm trying to be more

professional these days

I'm probably anybody and any

professional coaches here y'all got to

teach me how to do this

thing so how to be how to be

professional yo anybody can recommend me

to

someone hi a lot of

people I how to tell them a lie and make

them think is the truth so they would

feel good about it rather than learning

uncomfortable truths about themselves

and about what they're doing and can can

anybody got anybody got a coach for me

coach need a

[Music]

[Applause]

[Music]

coach this

is this is

[Music]

all right all right all right so I I

think that this is

um a perfect way to and I did tell y'all

I said um we get back above here I said

once we get into this Zone here you more

than likely see a rejection within here

and that rejection will let us know you

know whether price wants to trade higher

to here now it would be pure greed to be

in an entry here and go to try and

Target this High here be pure greed why

because there's no structural shifting

that's taking place as of yet what do I

mean by that I mean that as we're

putting in these highs and lows heading

up right we put in that low we put in

this low here put another high here when

we trade it below here there's no body

closure below this low so this high is

not

validated so what we had was a quick

shift below and the body pulled back

up so that right there becomes a down

candle that took a low that could send

price higher and what take out the high

that's not a part of structure so what

did we go and do

we trade it up to tap onto

What tap onto the low that did produce a

high right you see this this High missed

it let me just move some of these

drawings

out this oh come

on this High missed it right

here that high missed it but this High

hit it

so what it's actually hitting

is that little tiny Zone inside of there

tapped right into it you see another

move down now this

becomes the validated high right sorry

the the protected high and this was a

validated low moving back into that why

is it a validated low because it put in

a low and closed up above the previous

candle's high now putting in a low and

closing up above the previous previous

candles high does not mean that because

this low traded below the previous low

and did not close that doesn't classify

as a low it could still classify as a

low if it moves up and puts in a closure

above that high then you see us move

back down below it so all all we're

doing

is when we're focusing on these swings

heading down this just becomes the third

swing in this down move right here so

you in anticipate through here another

move back into there and should we get

stuck putting an equal low here then you

can see that go back up to take out this

high and why would it take out that high

because that high into that low right

here remember what we talked

about the larger structure we were

following right the larger structure we

were following so we know that this

could in turn move back up to put in a

fourth High we have one we have two we

have three so four to six then we expect

price to reverse right so we're still

trading down into this this structure we

came out of but what we're following is

the higher time frame highs and lows and

what we're taking little entries off of

are what makes up those higher time

frame highs and lows because what

happens is if we end up taking a short

out of these areas look at how long you

stay around in in that short before

price actually leaves the area and then

when price gets down here and moves back

up to there again now it's just right

back to your entry or right near your

entry for you to want to get price to

push away potentially if you're

targeting this sell side right here

you would take some time in that

entry rather than just being able to

find these little moves within price and

you can create your own 100 Point moves

inside of here you don't need to be a

part of a move that you held it all the

way for 100 point you can create that

for

yourself you know and I think that's the

the the demons that a lot of people

fight they want more but they don't

understand that they can create more if

they learned more right you can create

more if you learn more you never need to

be a part of holding the move from the

top other people other systems they

might do that stuff and some days when

they can't find a move that delivers

that they're out of the market every day

you can find a move utilizing what it is

that we teach here every

day no matter what's happening in the

market oh this is a bad day to trade

because what something happened in

another country and we have no idea

what's what the response is going to

going to

be okay and and if you go back if you

let's let's go back to

to let's go back to Dow

Jones oh we have we had no idea you kof

was going to take place but was that

tradeable coming out of it yes oh we we

had no idea that the 2008 crash going to

take did did we did we come out of that

too oh we had no

idea Black Monday and all that other

stuff is is take but but did we come out

of there was there a way to trade our

way out those large moves they're not

for us that's not our money in those

large moves but we need to understand

that every time those things

happen we have opportunity now but

should we be highly leveraged and fatten

up at this High we lose

everything going that way

everything because we want higher prices

price dips back and then trades up above

trades right back above there Taps back

into it and then trades higher that's

the thing that we mentioned on

rice has the possibility of taking that

high tapping back in and then trading

higher on

Rice you do that with gold do that with

whatever it is that that's connected to

your daily living so it's time for you

to learn what you need to learn and do

what you have to do so you can do what

you want to

do and I I'll continue to say it over

and over again fast scalping sorry is

the fastest way to to any sort of

acceleration of

wealth scalping learning how to scalp

this is one of the most liquid markets

in the world yet people think they need

to be in a move from up here holding the

move all the way from up

here and they need to be in it heading

all the way down to this low like you

some Allstar fund manager that

that you know you you trying to win an

award for who held who held the entry to

longest who made the most money for no

you're trying to save your life you're

trying to save

yourself that's what it is is is it's in

the details of these things that you're

going to learn how to operate within the

details of

them and then what what's that part of

risk management that we talked about the

part risk management that we talked

about was paying yourself that needs to

be a

Cornerstone a

Cornerstone in your risk management a

Cornerstone needs to be to pay yourself

you don't have to be a part of every

single move that's inside of here you

never need to be a part of every single

move you can

find you you can just find yourself in

one or two moves take little short

scalps within

there and and walk out for the day I had

a guy in the Discord that said he was up

$620 on a

day yeah I'm going to come back in an

hour for what you should come back

tomorrow because if you go out there you

have no credentials you have no skill

you have no degrees that's going to

support a job ever paying you

$620 for the little bit of minutes you

traded to make this so come back

tomorrow that's

greed I I don't know if he came back

tomorrow I can't you tell you what

happened I hope he listened you

know but you can find these little

things within

price pay yourself more than a job would

ever pay you what whatever skill or

credential you have and then just come

back the next day

was 400 bucks today and 400 bucks

tomorrow 400 bucks each day two 300

bucks each day what's that that replaces

your entire

salary

so that should always be the

goal you know and you don't have to be a

part of everything to make that just

simple things know when we're in a Range

trade based on a

range have clear

exits and say hey this is enough no job

would ever pay me more than this so I'll

come back to work

tomorrow

right and you know that that solves a

lot of your your financial hardship and

now you get to focus on life

now you get to focus on cleaning those

things up that you've been carrying that

you have not even been able to stop and

address whether it's things at home with

your partner whether it's things with

your kids whoever it is you have enough

time now to stop and deal with

them before they get

worse cuz life is not about

money it's about the time that you spend

with your loved ones the time you spend

with your Offspring whoever it is the

time you spend with those close to you

that's what life is about because when

you're

gone tomorrow that same bus that you

take to work the same train you take to

work the same same you know workplace

you you show up to to do what you have

to do the same news channels you love to

watch that movie that was schedule for

next week guess what it's still going to

show up it's still going to keep running

that movie is still going to drop

whether you dead or alive but guess

whose World

changes guess who whose World changes

the people you left

behind the people you left

behind I don't have enough money to die

and have my kids never depend on anybody

else

again I don't have enough possessions to

die and my kids never depend on anybody

else again that's the goal in life I

don't care if I have to die trying I

don't care if I don't get to rest while

in pursuit of

it they should never have to depend on

anybody else for shelter they should

never have to depend on a job to pay

them peanuts and treat them like their

mules

they should have choice in what they

want to do in life what they love to do

how they want to give back to

humanity so that's the drive for me

that's what keeps me coming back and I

know there's people out there in

financial hardship that can't get those

things that's why I do these live

streams that's why I come out here and

teach yeah I'm disgusted by the public

and the trading space but guess what

it's still my duty to help somebody else

be able to help themselves to help

somebody else be able to help their kids

what good is it for my kids to live a

comfortable life and their friends

struggle or people their age they run

into and have issues with because of

whatever it is basic

needs basic

needs we talking about being okay with

kids in poverty kids not being able to

eat kids and and and parents yeah some

parents are the the problem for that but

those things are

generational somebody's willing to break

that curse somebody's willing to get out

of

that and that's what brings you here to

these streams whether you like to hear

me or

not that's what brings you

here this might be pushing back up into

that previous high that it put in the

little shortterm high

that's what brings you

here and you got to put in that

time because you owe it to the people

around you just like I feel as though I

owe it to mankind I owe it to others to

do it it's my duty to do

it you know you you have everything here

everybody's course is leaked

I mean I don't have a course they're

just live streams they leaking and me

yelling at people but you that's what

they want to Ed to learn again

everybody's stuff is

leaked all the information in the world

you have and you can still sit there and

act like you need more it's all out

there but it's you you need you this

time you are Enigma I say that all the

time not my Concepts not anybody else's

Concepts

you you are Enigma you need you you

don't need me your family needs you they

don't need

me and when you put in that time you're

going to see that you're able to do

this you can do this trust me you can

it's all in your head trying to lie to

you and tell you you can't no you can

but you got to have more discipline than

you currently have now

so hope you guys uh enjoyed this uh this

stream and I'm going leave youall on

this

lot of public engagement you got people

like Charles he's running um his free

Discord right now people like sto you

talk on um Twitter with you know just

join the gang look for the DTF X hashtag

and just follow everybody that that's a

part of it you might got some you might

have some weirdos there you know that's

fine you have weirdos in every

discipline might have some weirdos there

but um you know partner up with some of

these people you're not alone you're not

by yourself so I'll catch up with you
