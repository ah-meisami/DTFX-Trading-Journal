Chapter 1. Mind Over Matter


### 5 Mental Hindrances to Self-Discipline
1. giving in to the ϐive senses
2. animosity and malice
3. apathy and laziness
4. anxiety and remorse
5. hesitation and doubt

```
To attain self-discipline, we need to put sensory information in its
proper context: allowing ourselves to indulge in and experience those
senses fully but also keeping aware that they are temporary, distracting,
and ultimately hindrances.

### The Brain That Works Against You

self-interests vs. self-discipline

Pleasure Principle:
1. Every decision we make is based on gaining pleasure or avoiding pain in some way.
2. People work harder to avoid pain than to get pleasure. 
3. Our perceptions of pleasure and pain are more powerful drivers than the actual things.
4. Pleasure and pain are changed by time.
5. Emotion beats logic.

### In the pursuit of self-discipline, strategically:
1. Decide what you want. 
2. Take inventory of your pain and pleasure. 
3. Tip the scales in your favor.


### Time Orientation
1. past-oriented
2. present-oriented (hedonists vs. fatalists)
3. future-oriented 

### It’s Up to You

positive effects of self-discipline:

Chapter 2. Understand the Cycle; Break the Cycle

Psychological discomfort is created because you know you are avoiding your responsibilities, so you engage in a distraction to alleviate that discomfort.

### The Cycle of Laziness
1. Unhelpful Assumptions or Made-Up Rules
2. Increasing Discomfort
3. Making Excuses
4. Avoidance Activities
5. Negative and Positive Consequences

```
 negative consequences create ==>> pessimism.
 positive consequences create ==>> self-sabotage.
 ```

### The Cycle of Laziness to create your own new business:
1. because you are operating under unhelpful assumptions, 
2. Increasing Discomfort
3. which cause you to make excuses 
4. that lead to avoidance 
5. that, in turn, results in consequences that hamper your self-discipline.


### Breaking the Cycle

- Ask “why” five times


```
Impulses have been the subject of psychological research for many
years. Recently, researchers from the European Molecular Biology
Laboratory have found strong connections between two parts of the
brain related to impulse control: the prefrontal cortex, the part of the
brain responsible for complex cognition, personality, decision-making,
and social behavior, and the brainstem, the portion of the brain that
regulates basic autonomic functions such as heart rate and breathing.
```

```
This means that we possess a significant number of connections that
allow us to self-regulate and control—it takes a conscious thought in our
prefrontal cortex, and it travels to our brainstem for calm and
relaxation. When we have a strong link between the two, we can better
exercise self-discipline.
```

```
How does this translate to humans? This research sheds light on what 
How does this translate to humans? This research sheds light on what is
happening in your brain when you’re trying to control an impulse. If
we’re in an emotional state, the connection between the prefrontal
cortex and the brainstem is weakened. We become more impulsive and
less self-aware.
```

```
We can’t very well take drugs to strengthen our neural connections and
maintain self-discipline better, but we can try to ensure that our
prefrontal cortex is engaged as much as possible. That roughly
translates to making decisions based on analysis and rationality versus
emotion. Self-discipline won’t win in the face of urgency, anxiety, and
fear, so you have to let them pass and then keep on keeping on. When
we’re thinking with our brainstem, which isn’t always something we can
control, our self-discipline goes out the window.
