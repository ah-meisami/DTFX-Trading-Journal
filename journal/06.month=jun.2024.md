| ðŸ’š `the 1st trade I take with new thought process & Logic` |
| :--- |
| ![DTFX](https://www.tradingview.com/x/7zH2URB3/ "DTFX") |
```java
[1]. Price entered in HTF Bearish Zone
[2]. Price created a 15m BOS
[3]. Price Throwing out early Sellers 
[4]. Price cleared previous BSL, so SL is above PH. (there is no need for price to go above PH)

I was wrong in Selecting TP

| ðŸ’š `I was correct in detecting market type (Ranging\MMBM) & also in directional bias (Bullish) despite STRONG bearish move` |
| :--- |
| ![DTFX](https://www.tradingview.com/x/O0CkX0dR/ "DTFX") |
```java
[1]. F-TC previous HTF low
[2]. Close above Supply  zone with SPEED
[3]. $SL= Demand Broken Act as Supply, So expecting Retracement. Plus Price Expectation is like Model3 so expecting Reversal in LTF
[4]. $TP= Institutional Sponsorship: ({1}. SSL cleared {2}. Respecting Low {3}. Close Above Zone)
[5]. $MarketType= (London Session in Previous Day was Trending, So Today Expecting Ranging market in London Session)

00:25 This Low is taken
00:27 This High is taken
00:34 These Swing Poits Creates our Zone

00:37 We Traded Below the Zone
00:44 So this Zone is important for us to determine what's going to happen
00:48 We Closes Below
00:52 Traded at the 50%
00:53 Fail to trade at the Extreme Of the Zone (EOZ)
00:59 Fail to make another Low

01:16 In Asian Session Took the High
01:35 So this become our Flip Zone

02:47 If (1.we trade back to the Zone 2.we don't mitigate the 50% before), Then (everything at the 50% is a Fake Move) (we need to mitigate the low of 50% (=at the 70%) )
03:45 we came back to 70% but we didn't respect the 70% 
04:15 we can use the same zone for trading Higher and trading Lower

04:34 this Flip Zone was not mitigated: 1.trade below 2.trade above 3.without mitigation of 50%
