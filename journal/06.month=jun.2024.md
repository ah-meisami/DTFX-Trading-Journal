```java
[1]. Price entered in HTF Bearish Zone
[2]. Price created a 15m BOS
[3]. Price Throwing out early Sellers 
[4]. Price cleared previous BSL, so SL is above PH. (there is no need for price to go above PH)

| ðŸ’š `I was correct in detecting market type (Ranging\MMBM) & also in directional bias (Bullish) despite STRONG bearish move` |

```java
[1]. F-TC previous HTF low
[2]. Close above Supply  zone with SPEED
[3]. $SL= Demand Broken Act as Supply, So expecting Retracement. Plus Price Expectation is like Model3 so expecting Reversal in LTF
[4]. $TP= Institutional Sponsorship: ({1}. SSL cleared {2}. Respecting Low {3}. Close Above Zone)
[5]. $MarketType= (London Session in Previous Day was Trending, So Today Expecting Ranging market in London Session)
