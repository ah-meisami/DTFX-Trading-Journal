um

58
00:06:30,440 --> 00:06:34,479
I'm doing this uh stream here uh to be

59
00:06:34,479 --> 00:06:37,639
very uh

60
00:06:37,639 --> 00:06:41,199
concise about the

61
00:06:41,520 --> 00:06:45,120

00:06:47,479 --> 00:06:51,240
um again except

64
00:06:51,880 --> 00:06:54,639
bookmap because bookmap doesn't

65
00:06:54,639 --> 00:06:56,960
work so

66
00:06:56,960 --> 00:07:00,120
um uh this drawing you here you you see

67
00:07:00,120 --> 00:07:01,240
here

68
00:07:01,240 --> 00:07:05,080
um you know we uh knew that it would

69
00:07:05,080 --> 00:07:08,400
sort of work out this way one because of

70
00:07:08,400 --> 00:07:13,160
what we often you know uh trade with but

71
00:07:13,160 --> 00:07:16,759
two um because of noticing things that

72
00:07:16,759 --> 00:07:20,319
go alongside the things that we

73
00:07:20,319 --> 00:07:22,800
trade so

74
00:07:22,800 --> 00:07:25,879
um the very

75
00:07:25,879 --> 00:07:28,639
first uh thing I want to address is that

76
00:07:28,639 --> 00:07:30,560
I I am

77
00:07:30,560 --> 00:07:35,160
um I was watching this uh African guy I

78
00:07:35,160 --> 00:07:38,039
I don't know what his name is no idea

79
00:07:38,039 --> 00:07:41,199
who he is um I can't even remember the

80
00:07:41,199 --> 00:07:43,599
video um I'll probably try to find the

81
00:07:43,599 --> 00:07:46,639
video and post it to uh the group as

82
00:07:46,639 --> 00:07:49,400
well as

83
00:07:49,400 --> 00:07:52,240
um uh Twitter as well I was watching

84
00:07:52,240 --> 00:07:58,199
this African guy and he said that he was

85
00:07:58,199 --> 00:08:00,879
teaching I ICT

86
00:08:00,879 --> 00:08:05,000
Concepts Made Simple ICT Concepts Made

87
00:08:05,000 --> 00:08:07,039
Simple hey Mikey what's up what's up

88
00:08:07,039 --> 00:08:09,639
baby what's up hey I want to tell you

89
00:08:09,639 --> 00:08:13,879
your boy Tyler is soft uh I don't really

90
00:08:13,879 --> 00:08:15,720
take recommendations of people who ask

91
00:08:15,720 --> 00:08:17,680
me to open my group and make exceptions

92
00:08:17,680 --> 00:08:21,120
for people and um you know unfortunately

93
00:08:21,120 --> 00:08:23,720
I broke my rules and did it again but

94
00:08:23,720 --> 00:08:26,400
your boy Tyler's a softy I just need to

95
00:08:26,400 --> 00:08:31,200
let you know that um so

96
00:08:31,200 --> 00:08:33,240
um he was

97
00:08:33,240 --> 00:08:37,279
explaining ICT Concepts right and he

98
00:08:37,279 --> 00:08:39,839
mentioned how it was a simplifying

99
00:08:39,839 --> 00:08:42,440
version of it and you know whenever you

100
00:08:42,440 --> 00:08:45,200
see those those

101
00:08:45,200 --> 00:08:46,880
um

102
00:08:46,880 --> 00:08:51,200
uh whenever you see those uh uh videos

103
00:08:51,200 --> 00:08:53,880
you automatically think clickbait scam

104
00:08:53,880 --> 00:08:56,080
you know all of the other stuff but what

105
00:08:56,080 --> 00:08:58,120
I tend to do is spend my Saturdays

106
00:08:58,120 --> 00:09:01,720
watching the the week that has passed in

107
00:09:01,720 --> 00:09:03,920
review so I watch all of the streamers I

108
00:09:03,920 --> 00:09:06,279
look at just everything everything that

109
00:09:06,279 --> 00:09:09,839
that you know has occurred um throughout

110
00:09:09,839 --> 00:09:12,320
the week even on the different pairs and

111
00:09:12,320 --> 00:09:15,160
you know so I clicked on this one guy's

112
00:09:15,160 --> 00:09:18,519
video he was showing ict's Concepts on

113
00:09:18,519 --> 00:09:20,040
binary

114
00:09:20,040 --> 00:09:22,720
options um African guy

115
00:09:22,720 --> 00:09:26,120
named you mean St Kish TCM he's not

116
00:09:26,120 --> 00:09:30,120
African he's Jamaican so uh get it right

117
00:09:30,120 --> 00:09:33,560
um I was watching him

118
00:09:33,560 --> 00:09:37,640
and he was showing on binary options he

119
00:09:37,640 --> 00:09:39,120
was

120
00:09:39,120 --> 00:09:43,279
showing uh what I saw as Market

121
00:09:43,279 --> 00:09:45,800
structure on the way down right like

122
00:09:45,800 --> 00:09:48,279
this

123
00:09:50,920 --> 00:09:53,600
right and he was on the lower time

124
00:09:53,600 --> 00:09:56,480
frames doing that so let me

125
00:09:56,480 --> 00:09:59,920
um just make this look a a little better

126
00:09:59,920 --> 00:10:04,200
so my OCD doesn't you

127
00:10:07,360 --> 00:10:09,959
know so what he

128
00:10:09,959 --> 00:10:13,720
said what he said

129
00:10:13,720 --> 00:10:17,440
was as we

130
00:10:18,560 --> 00:10:21,480
see price actually let let me uh let me

131
00:10:21,480 --> 00:10:24,279
just make this

132
00:10:28,320 --> 00:10:31,320
here

133
00:10:32,040 --> 00:10:34,880
something like

134
00:10:41,480 --> 00:10:45,920
that maybe like that yeah that's

135
00:10:49,639 --> 00:10:53,680
fine so let's call

136
00:10:55,760 --> 00:10:58,240
this a high

137
00:10:58,240 --> 00:11:01,240
here

138
00:11:06,959 --> 00:11:10,839
come on let's call

139
00:11:10,839 --> 00:11:14,160
this an old high right here right at

140
00:11:14,160 --> 00:11:16,200
that red

141
00:11:16,200 --> 00:11:18,680
line what he was

142
00:11:18,680 --> 00:11:20,320
explaining

143
00:11:20,320 --> 00:11:23,160
was that when price took out that old

144
00:11:23,160 --> 00:11:26,839
high and it traded to this low right

145
00:11:26,839 --> 00:11:30,600
here he said each time

146
00:11:30,600 --> 00:11:32,560
and this is this is far better than any

147
00:11:32,560 --> 00:11:37,639
of the ICT um you know streamers or or

148
00:11:37,639 --> 00:11:39,600
teachers or whoever it is that has ever

149
00:11:39,600 --> 00:11:41,680
explained it I just learned today from a

150
00:11:41,680 --> 00:11:43,600
couple ICT Charter students we got quite

151
00:11:43,600 --> 00:11:46,639
a bit of them in in the group um that

152
00:11:46,639 --> 00:11:49,320
this is something that ICT has taught

153
00:11:49,320 --> 00:11:52,760
and explained many times

154
00:11:52,760 --> 00:11:56,160
um but you know for us it's it's Market

155
00:11:56,160 --> 00:11:58,720
structure right right break below the

156
00:11:58,720 --> 00:11:59,839
old low

157
00:11:59,839 --> 00:12:02,360
you put in a high you put in a high and

158
00:12:02,360 --> 00:12:04,760
low again high and low again right and

159
00:12:04,760 --> 00:12:08,320
we count 1 2 3 4 and then we up and see

160
00:12:08,320 --> 00:12:10,839
you know price reversed on you know four

161
00:12:10,839 --> 00:12:15,399
to six and trade high right so that's

162
00:12:15,399 --> 00:12:16,959
that's us that's in there we don't

163
00:12:16,959 --> 00:12:19,839
really have to consider that because we

164
00:12:19,839 --> 00:12:22,279
teach that on the channel already so

165
00:12:22,279 --> 00:12:24,680
what he mentioned was every time you see

166
00:12:24,680 --> 00:12:30,680
a low taken like this he talked about

167
00:12:30,680 --> 00:12:33,600
price he mentioned

168
00:12:33,600 --> 00:12:38,360
rebalancing to a fair value Gap so you

169
00:12:38,360 --> 00:12:39,320
have

170
00:12:39,320 --> 00:12:42,480
this low into this high that took out

171
00:12:42,480 --> 00:12:44,680
the inducement after a old high was

172
00:12:44,680 --> 00:12:47,680
taken right and it's essentially going

173
00:12:47,680 --> 00:12:52,399
down to the cell side right so he talked

174
00:12:52,399 --> 00:12:54,720
about it rebalancing

175
00:12:54,720 --> 00:12:57,120
into an

176
00:12:57,120 --> 00:13:01,240
fvg IT trades below old low goes back

177
00:13:01,240 --> 00:13:02,519
into the

178
00:13:02,519 --> 00:13:05,440
fvg so the same thing happens again

179
00:13:05,440 --> 00:13:07,680
trades below the old

180
00:13:07,680 --> 00:13:12,440
low goes back into an fvg

181
00:13:12,440 --> 00:13:15,440
right ra below the old low back into FG

182
00:13:15,440 --> 00:13:19,000
paid back to from WG right we we all we

183
00:13:19,000 --> 00:13:20,600
all understand that especially some of

184
00:13:20,600 --> 00:13:24,920
you guys that have uh come

185
00:13:24,920 --> 00:13:27,240
from ICT

186
00:13:27,240 --> 00:13:31,040
Concepts and then bam we hit cell

187
00:13:31,040 --> 00:13:34,920
sign let me just put that

188
00:13:38,320 --> 00:13:44,120
there so for us wew you know previous

189
00:13:44,120 --> 00:13:46,480
range previous range previous range

190
00:13:46,480 --> 00:13:47,760
previous range you know we don't have to

191
00:13:47,760 --> 00:13:49,839
go over

192
00:13:49,839 --> 00:13:51,560
that

193
00:13:51,560 --> 00:13:54,399
but when he explained this he was doing

194
00:13:54,399 --> 00:13:58,040
it live on something that people Call a

195
00:13:58,040 --> 00:14:00,360
scam binary

196
00:14:00,360 --> 00:14:02,440
options which is not a scam you just

197
00:14:02,440 --> 00:14:03,680
don't know how to trade

198
00:14:03,680 --> 00:14:06,720
it um and that that's for most things

199
00:14:06,720 --> 00:14:08,560
that you would even call a scam you CME

200
00:14:08,560 --> 00:14:10,079
manipulation well it's just that you

201
00:14:10,079 --> 00:14:15,199
don't know how to trade it um so it's

202
00:14:15,199 --> 00:14:18,759
taking old lows rebalancing into fbgs

203
00:14:18,759 --> 00:14:22,240
right so in terms of Market structure

204
00:14:22,240 --> 00:14:24,759
it's a series of highs and

205
00:14:24,759 --> 00:14:29,720
lows or or uh um lower highs and lower

206
00:14:29,720 --> 00:14:33,000
lows heading down

207
00:14:33,000 --> 00:14:35,519
right

208
00:14:35,519 --> 00:14:38,079
so with that understanding of knowing

209
00:14:38,079 --> 00:14:40,920
that price does this and with us not

210
00:14:40,920 --> 00:14:43,040
needing to use ICT Concepts we don't use

211
00:14:43,040 --> 00:14:44,959
it at all we don't care about fugs none

212
00:14:44,959 --> 00:14:47,440
of that we we already got past that

213
00:14:47,440 --> 00:14:49,199
stuff we don't even use imbalances we

214
00:14:49,199 --> 00:14:50,440
don't look at them we don't even want to

215
00:14:50,440 --> 00:14:53,480
see them

216
00:14:53,480 --> 00:14:59,839
but what the understanding of this is

217
00:14:59,839 --> 00:15:02,040
is that this

218
00:15:02,040 --> 00:15:04,360
is

219
00:15:04,360 --> 00:15:09,600
keeping structure intact right

220
00:15:09,600 --> 00:15:13,560
until we take out the old low right and

221
00:15:13,560 --> 00:15:17,120
then you see a move going back into that

222
00:15:17,120 --> 00:15:19,680
range but what happens

223
00:15:19,680 --> 00:15:21,880
here often times when we take out that

224
00:15:21,880 --> 00:15:23,720
old low y'all remember y you remember

225
00:15:23,720 --> 00:15:27,040
what I teach we end up getting

226
00:15:27,040 --> 00:15:29,600
accumulation right

227
00:15:29,600 --> 00:15:31,360
so we see the

228
00:15:31,360 --> 00:15:36,480
accumulation occur which drives us down

229
00:15:36,480 --> 00:15:38,880
into the manipulation and then you see a

230
00:15:38,880 --> 00:15:42,120
distribution coming out this often times

231
00:15:42,120 --> 00:15:45,399
is what people are getting cooked up in

232
00:15:45,399 --> 00:15:48,279
trying to trade that with no knowledge

233
00:15:48,279 --> 00:15:50,279
of how to trade it because it's entirely

234
00:15:50,279 --> 00:15:51,639
tradeable but you just don't have the

235
00:15:51,639 --> 00:15:53,759
knowledge to trade it so when we get

236
00:15:53,759 --> 00:15:55,759
into that low and we begin to

237
00:15:55,759 --> 00:15:58,360
consolidate and we manipulate lower and

238
00:15:58,360 --> 00:15:59,480
trade higher

239
00:15:59,480 --> 00:16:01,440
what did he end up calling that there's

240
00:16:01,440 --> 00:16:04,199
another portion of his Concepts right

241
00:16:04,199 --> 00:16:06,639
where they call it

242
00:16:06,639 --> 00:16:08,199
the

243
00:16:08,199 --> 00:16:10,560
accumulation the manipulation trust me I

244
00:16:10,560 --> 00:16:12,399
do not care what color these boxes are

245
00:16:12,399 --> 00:16:14,040
supposed to be I don't trade

246
00:16:14,040 --> 00:16:18,160
ICT and a distribution right and that

247
00:16:18,160 --> 00:16:21,079
distribution you could

248
00:16:21,079 --> 00:16:24,079
anticipate

249
00:16:24,199 --> 00:16:27,360
running the old high up above right

250
00:16:27,360 --> 00:16:30,639
going back to run by side and taking

251
00:16:30,639 --> 00:16:34,240
out what they

252
00:16:34,240 --> 00:16:37,360
call low resistance liquidity run all

253
00:16:37,360 --> 00:16:38,959
that other you know Jazz that they put

254
00:16:38,959 --> 00:16:40,680
in there let me just move some of this

255
00:16:40,680 --> 00:16:43,519
stuff so it doesn't look as

256
00:16:43,519 --> 00:16:46,120
messy than let me make sure I don't

257
00:16:46,120 --> 00:16:48,600
delete

258
00:16:48,680 --> 00:16:52,279
everything so the thing

259
00:16:52,279 --> 00:16:56,279
that a lot of uh

260
00:16:56,279 --> 00:16:59,519
um you know people do not understand

261
00:16:59,519 --> 00:17:02,519
and is that oh I forgot I forgot I got I

262
00:17:02,519 --> 00:17:06,280
got a you know oh fvg you know OMG and

263
00:17:06,280 --> 00:17:07,959
then then train highight

264
00:17:07,959 --> 00:17:10,039
right the thing that a lot of people do

265
00:17:10,039 --> 00:17:12,760
not pay attention to within this

266
00:17:12,760 --> 00:17:15,959
particular construct here is

267
00:17:15,959 --> 00:17:19,319
one when we're trending versus when

268
00:17:19,319 --> 00:17:21,520
we're ranging right two different

269
00:17:21,520 --> 00:17:25,559
environments this can happen on the 4H

270
00:17:25,559 --> 00:17:27,559
hour time frame this can be 4H hour

271
00:17:27,559 --> 00:17:29,760
highs and lows that we have have here

272
00:17:29,760 --> 00:17:32,720
right four hour highs and lows this

273
00:17:32,720 --> 00:17:35,039
could be on the one minute be one minute

274
00:17:35,039 --> 00:17:36,640
highs and lows this could be on the

275
00:17:36,640 --> 00:17:38,520
weekly weekly highs and

276
00:17:38,520 --> 00:17:40,840
lows doesn't matter what time frame it's

277
00:17:40,840 --> 00:17:45,160
on it matters about what's occurring so

278
00:17:45,160 --> 00:17:47,679
what we end up having is this

279
00:17:47,679 --> 00:17:50,000
accumulation and on days where we have

280
00:17:50,000 --> 00:17:51,600
accumulation this is where a lot of

281
00:17:51,600 --> 00:17:53,320
people getting cooked up oh it's SE can

282
00:17:53,320 --> 00:17:56,039
destroy you know don't don't trade it

283
00:17:56,039 --> 00:17:58,679
it's garbage PA because you saw some

284
00:17:58,679 --> 00:18:00,320
little little tiny imbalance open up

285
00:18:00,320 --> 00:18:03,480
inside of here and that tiny imbalance

286
00:18:03,480 --> 00:18:05,840
you were supposed to be able to take

287
00:18:05,840 --> 00:18:08,679
that imbalance and then begin the move

288
00:18:08,679 --> 00:18:10,440
higher and then you shift it to break

289
00:18:10,440 --> 00:18:12,559
even and you watch it go lower and then

290
00:18:12,559 --> 00:18:14,640
you end up taking an imbalance inside of

291
00:18:14,640 --> 00:18:16,760
here and you wanted to go down to sell

292
00:18:16,760 --> 00:18:19,080
side and end up trading up above into

293
00:18:19,080 --> 00:18:21,880
into you know your your stop loss there

294
00:18:21,880 --> 00:18:24,120
and then you saw it trade higher and

295
00:18:24,120 --> 00:18:26,799
then you wanted to go into your OT here

296
00:18:26,799 --> 00:18:29,000
and you end up getting oted back back

297
00:18:29,000 --> 00:18:30,200
below because you thought it was

298
00:18:30,200 --> 00:18:32,120
supposed to trade higher there that's

299
00:18:32,120 --> 00:18:34,559
the days where you're creating this

300
00:18:34,559 --> 00:18:36,720
understanding or or or this

301
00:18:36,720 --> 00:18:38,280
idea

302
00:18:38,280 --> 00:18:41,880
that price is supposed to go higher or

303
00:18:41,880 --> 00:18:43,760
it's supposed to go lower we're bullish

304
00:18:43,760 --> 00:18:45,280
no we're bearish no we're bullish no we

305
00:18:45,280 --> 00:18:46,919
bearish nowh bullish nowh bearish nowh

306
00:18:46,919 --> 00:18:50,080
bullish nowh bearish back and

307
00:18:50,080 --> 00:18:53,320
forth hop skipping and jumping in your

308
00:18:53,320 --> 00:18:56,159
bias like like Joey G powerful Joe G or

309
00:18:56,159 --> 00:18:58,799
whatever you call weak weak sauce Jo G

310
00:18:58,799 --> 00:19:00,080
Mighty Joe Young whatever you want to

311
00:19:00,080 --> 00:19:02,640
call them you you you just flipping your

312
00:19:02,640 --> 00:19:04,440
bias oh you got to know when to change

313
00:19:04,440 --> 00:19:06,880
the bias no that sounds like

314
00:19:06,880 --> 00:19:09,799
buffoonery you need to understand what

315
00:19:09,799 --> 00:19:13,280
price is doing and when it is doing it

316
00:19:13,280 --> 00:19:18,640
and how it looks so we have this right

317
00:19:18,640 --> 00:19:22,760
now one thing that the ICT Traders

318
00:19:22,760 --> 00:19:26,880
love to do is trash other

319
00:19:26,880 --> 00:19:29,559
Concepts trash them the only concept i

320
00:19:29,559 --> 00:19:32,200
trash is book map that's it nothing else

321
00:19:32,200 --> 00:19:35,440
but they love to trash other Concepts so

322
00:19:35,440 --> 00:19:38,640
here goes the other Concepts getting

323
00:19:38,640 --> 00:19:40,679
thrown into the

324
00:19:40,679 --> 00:19:44,000
mix now you have the support and

325
00:19:44,000 --> 00:19:45,919
resistance

326
00:19:45,919 --> 00:19:48,120
guys who are

327
00:19:48,120 --> 00:19:50,919
saying well it's just

328
00:19:50,919 --> 00:19:54,760
repackaged resistance turn support you

329
00:19:54,760 --> 00:19:56,360
know they they in here and and they back

330
00:19:56,360 --> 00:19:57,640
up

331
00:19:57,640 --> 00:20:01,400
here and it's just going to the next

332
00:20:01,400 --> 00:20:04,840
level of resistance after it finds the

333
00:20:04,840 --> 00:20:07,919
support and the ICT Traders

334
00:20:07,919 --> 00:20:12,120
go well when we take out this old high

335
00:20:12,120 --> 00:20:15,080
up above right take out that old

336
00:20:15,080 --> 00:20:17,240
high we're looking for price to

337
00:20:17,240 --> 00:20:20,039
rebalance back into an fug that could be

338
00:20:20,039 --> 00:20:22,799
a form of a breaker to the left

339
00:20:22,799 --> 00:20:25,880
and price higher

340
00:20:25,880 --> 00:20:28,360
right and the the support and resistance

341
00:20:28,360 --> 00:20:32,400
guys saying well it's just a break above

342
00:20:32,400 --> 00:20:33,840
the resistance and then it turn into

343
00:20:33,840 --> 00:20:36,240
support and then and it's going for the

344
00:20:36,240 --> 00:20:39,880
other it's going for the other level of

345
00:20:39,880 --> 00:20:41,840
and guess

346
00:20:41,840 --> 00:20:45,360
what the guys that want to be right

347
00:20:45,360 --> 00:20:47,760
about all of this and all of that and

348
00:20:47,760 --> 00:20:49,400
all of that and all of that and all of

349
00:20:49,400 --> 00:20:50,880
that and all of that and all of that and

350
00:20:50,880 --> 00:20:54,679
all of that and all of that they make no

351
00:20:54,679 --> 00:21:00,840
money over complicating it zero

352
00:21:00,840 --> 00:21:03,880
dollar because you have to wait for the

353
00:21:03,880 --> 00:21:07,080
8:30 Kill Zone within the orbital

354
00:21:07,080 --> 00:21:09,760
construct of the vertex and then after

355
00:21:09,760 --> 00:21:12,360
it has formed then you should be

356
00:21:12,360 --> 00:21:16,200
targeting with the smallest stop

357
00:21:16,200 --> 00:21:18,640
possible and you getting stopped out

358
00:21:18,640 --> 00:21:19,960
stopped out stopped out stopped out

359
00:21:19,960 --> 00:21:22,039
stopped out then you flip your bias and

360
00:21:22,039 --> 00:21:23,880
now you getting stop out stop out stop

361
00:21:23,880 --> 00:21:26,360
out stop out stop

362
00:21:26,360 --> 00:21:29,400
out right

363
00:21:29,400 --> 00:21:31,240
St down a little

364
00:21:31,240 --> 00:21:34,120
more and now you went and got a little

365
00:21:34,120 --> 00:21:37,880
bit of profit within

366
00:21:37,880 --> 00:21:40,240
there and you showing on Twitter how you

367
00:21:40,240 --> 00:21:42,880
call a whole move

368
00:21:42,880 --> 00:21:46,000
up you caught the whole thing yeah oh I

369
00:21:46,000 --> 00:21:48,320
forgot my my bad wait wait I forgot we

370
00:21:48,320 --> 00:21:51,279
we forgot how could we

371
00:21:51,279 --> 00:21:53,679
forget how could we we got to we got to

372
00:21:53,679 --> 00:21:57,159
leave a purple line no no no maybe maybe

373
00:21:57,159 --> 00:21:59,559
Brown we we got to put a Brown Line

374
00:21:59,559 --> 00:22:02,000
there we forgot all about that cuz we

375
00:22:02,000 --> 00:22:05,559
have the toilet soup that's down below

376
00:22:05,559 --> 00:22:08,279
here that act

377
00:22:08,279 --> 00:22:11,760
like they reinvented the whole market

378
00:22:11,760 --> 00:22:14,600
and now it unlocks the market We we

379
00:22:14,600 --> 00:22:17,120

occurring and people are on social media

444
00:25:04,640 --> 00:25:06,279
arguing

445
00:25:06,279 --> 00:25:10,440
about what is the correct way that the

446
00:25:10,440 --> 00:25:12,559
market actually moves when you could

stuff in there you have everything

452
00:25:27,320 --> 00:25:30,320
here

453
00:25:30,840 --> 00:25:32,799
and everybody knows the

454
00:25:32,799 --> 00:25:35,559
Encyclopedia of every single concept

455
00:25:35,559 --> 00:25:38,039
here that

456
00:25:38,080 --> 00:25:41,480
exist and cannot pull a single dollar

457
00:25:41,480 --> 00:25:42,960
out of the

458
00:25:42,960 --> 00:25:46,039
market because what no matter what it is

459
00:25:46,039 --> 00:25:49,320
oh my gosh hold up wait wait

460
00:25:49,320 --> 00:25:54,520

forgot I forgot the the

462
00:25:58,919 --> 00:26:02,880
the the OT games my

463
00:26:02,880 --> 00:26:06,600
bad can't forget about

464
00:26:06,600 --> 00:26:09,520
them and

465
00:26:09,520 --> 00:26:14,320
then let's say this is uh

466
00:26:14,720 --> 00:26:18,240
uh let's say this is uh

467
00:26:18,240 --> 00:26:24,320
um just make it red a brighter Hue of

468
00:26:26,000 --> 00:26:28,919
red because my man profitable losers in

469
00:26:28,919 --> 00:26:31,200
there can't forget about

470
00:26:31,200 --> 00:26:36,399
that all of these different things are

471
00:26:36,600 --> 00:26:39,880
here all of these different things are

472
00:26:39,880 --> 00:26:42,919
here and the market moves in every

473
00:26:42,919 --> 00:26:47,120
single way possible in here right every

474
00:26:47,120 --> 00:26:51,399
single concept we watch occurring here

475
00:26:51,399 --> 00:26:55,240
the market does

476
00:26:55,240 --> 00:26:58,640
it Market does it and that's with and

477
00:26:58,640 --> 00:27:00,520
without

478
00:27:00,520 --> 00:27:04,640
time with and

479
00:27:04,640 --> 00:27:07,640
without

480
00:27:08,480 --> 00:27:12,799
time with and without time it does

481
00:27:12,799 --> 00:27:14,840
this

482
00:27:14,840 --> 00:27:17,840
so when the market Moves In This

483
00:27:17,840 --> 00:27:20,200
fashion there's plenty of people who

484
00:27:20,200 --> 00:27:23,360
have the opportunity to make

485
00:27:23,360 --> 00:27:27,159
money utilizing any part of these

486
00:27:27,159 --> 00:27:28,600
Concepts that they choose you can put

487
00:27:28,600 --> 00:27:30,679
Elliot wave in there you can put wank

488
00:27:30,679 --> 00:27:32,960
off in there you can put Gan theory in

489
00:27:32,960 --> 00:27:36,360
there you can put the the the uh uh soup

490
00:27:36,360 --> 00:27:38,200
Traders the the turtle sorry not the

491
00:27:38,200 --> 00:27:39,799
soup Traders we already got them toilet

492
00:27:39,799 --> 00:27:42,640
soup do you can put the the the turtle

493
00:27:42,640 --> 00:27:44,880
traders in there you know during that

494
00:27:44,880 --> 00:27:47,120
time you can put the market structure

495
00:27:47,120 --> 00:27:50,039
traders in there you can put any Trader

496
00:27:50,039 --> 00:27:53,600
you want in this

497
00:27:53,600 --> 00:27:56,880
Dynamic and they all have the

498
00:27:56,880 --> 00:27:59,880
opportunity to make

499
00:27:59,880 --> 00:28:03,120
money and the people who know the ins

500
00:28:03,120 --> 00:28:07,200
and outs of every single bit of

501
00:28:07,200 --> 00:28:11,559
this can walk away with

502
00:28:11,559 --> 00:28:16,120
nothing can walk away not being able to

503
00:28:16,120 --> 00:28:19,080
take a single dollar out of the market

504
00:28:19,080 --> 00:28:21,519
why because they've

505
00:28:21,519 --> 00:28:24,039
mastered these Concepts and the way they

506
00:28:24,039 --> 00:28:25,799
look in

507
00:28:25,799 --> 00:28:29,080
hindsight but as it's occurring

508
00:28:29,080 --> 00:28:31,440
they have not

509
00:28:31,440 --> 00:28:34,440
mastered

510
00:28:35,399 --> 00:28:40,039
themselves they sell low and they buy

511
00:28:40,039 --> 00:28:43,559
high they remove their

512
00:28:43,559 --> 00:28:47,360
stoploss they they are

513
00:28:47,360 --> 00:28:51,039
greedy they want to be right about

514
00:28:51,039 --> 00:28:52,159
what's

515
00:28:52,159 --> 00:28:55,200
occurring rather than making

516
00:28:55,200 --> 00:28:58,880
money and they come on Twitter and they

517
00:28:58,880 --> 00:29:01,320
attack

518
00:29:01,320 --> 00:29:03,320
everybody for what they know is

519
00:29:03,320 --> 00:29:05,559
occurring and it's this and it's that

520
00:29:05,559 --> 00:29:08,440
and look at him he was wrong and he the

521
00:29:08,440 --> 00:29:14,320
loudest people in there make zero

522
00:29:14,320 --> 00:29:16,360
do and that's why they have all that

523
00:29:16,360 --> 00:29:18,000
time to just be out

524
00:29:18,000 --> 00:29:20,600
there clacking their

525
00:29:20,600 --> 00:29:22,279
mouth

526
00:29:22,279 --> 00:29:25,960
Zer while all of it is occurring ICT

527
00:29:25,960 --> 00:29:29,600
Concepts work DTF effect Concepts

528
00:29:29,600 --> 00:29:32,480
work toilet soup Concepts work after

529
00:29:32,480 --> 00:29:34,760
you've been stopped out 500 times the

530
00:29:34,760 --> 00:29:38,799
SMC Concepts work do what whatever it is

531
00:29:38,799 --> 00:29:41,200
that's there support and resistance

532
00:29:41,200 --> 00:29:44,360
Works Market structure

533
00:29:44,360 --> 00:29:48,240
works all of it every bit of it and for

534
00:29:48,240 --> 00:29:51,640
the ones I hav't even name they all work

535
00:29:51,640 --> 00:29:55,000
but guess who doesn't

536
00:29:55,120 --> 00:29:57,039
work

537
00:29:57,039 --> 00:30:00,039
you

538
00:30:01,600 --> 00:30:03,799
you are the

539
00:30:03,799 --> 00:30:06,519
one that doesn't

540
00:30:06,519 --> 00:30:10,679
work you can't master

541
00:30:11,720 --> 00:30:15,799
yourself you can't see your setup take

542
00:30:15,799 --> 00:30:20,200
your setup exit the market

543
00:30:20,200 --> 00:30:22,840
profitably and show back up the next day

544
00:30:22,840 --> 00:30:24,240
to do it

545
00:30:24,240 --> 00:30:26,600
again why because you need the Instagram

546
00:30:26,600 --> 00:30:28,720
worthy shot

547
00:30:28,720 --> 00:30:31,240
you need to be right

548
00:30:31,240 --> 00:30:34,559
about where it's going when this is a

549
00:30:34,559 --> 00:30:37,160
market that's not even designed for

550
00:30:37,160 --> 00:30:38,399
[Music]

price the greed takes

558
00:31:03,960 --> 00:31:08,159

00:31:39,679 --> 00:31:42,360
future you out there yelling on Twitter

569
00:31:42,360 --> 00:31:45,399
acting like you got it all

570
00:31:45,399 --> 00:31:49,200
together knowing that you want to claim

571
00:31:49,200 --> 00:31:51,080
public success right but you are behind

572
00:31:51,080 --> 00:31:53,480
the scenes

573
00:31:53,559 --> 00:31:57,000
failure and you know it deep down inside

574
00:31:57,000 --> 00:31:59,039
and it's easier just to project it on to

575
00:31:59,039 --> 00:32:02,159
other people rather than get yourself

576
00:32:02,159 --> 00:32:05,679
together if you got to go to therapy go

577
00:32:05,679 --> 00:32:08,639
if you got to go to church go wherever

578
00:32:08,639 --> 00:32:10,960
it is you have to go to fix yourself and

579
00:32:10,960 --> 00:32:15,080
fix your life so you can get involved in

580
00:32:15,080 --> 00:32:17,559
this because all of it is out there

581
00:32:17,559 --> 00:32:20,639
trust me every course has been

582
00:32:20,639 --> 00:32:26,639
leaked every course has been

583
00:32:26,840 --> 00:32:31,279
leaked hey you still get margin cold

584
00:32:31,279 --> 00:32:34,960
baby still getting

585
00:32:34,960 --> 00:32:37,120
cooked with every course in the world

586
00:32:37,120 --> 00:32:38,480
out

587
00:32:38,480 --> 00:32:41,080
there it's not the material it's not the

588
00:32:41,080 --> 00:32:44,399
concepts you can pick one in here and be

589
00:32:44,399 --> 00:32:46,679
successful with it I was successful with

590
00:32:46,679 --> 00:32:48,840
trend line

591
00:32:48,840 --> 00:32:52,639
trading that was my first concept and

592
00:32:52,639 --> 00:32:55,840
profitability trend line

593
00:32:55,840 --> 00:32:59,559
trading all the people giving T trades

594
00:32:59,559 --> 00:33:02,080
hell cuz she trendline trading and she

595
00:33:02,080 --> 00:33:04,200
showed up with the 1099 B from her

596
00:33:04,200 --> 00:33:07,600
broker and you ain't hear nothing ever

597
00:33:07,600 --> 00:33:12,159
since trendline trading could be

598
00:33:13,880 --> 00:33:16,320
profitable but it's

599
00:33:16,320 --> 00:33:18,840
you that's who it

600
00:33:18,840 --> 00:33:23,480
is it's you it's

601
00:33:23,480 --> 00:33:26,760
you so you got to get yourself

602
00:33:26,760 --> 00:33:29,320
together get off social

603
00:33:29,320 --> 00:33:32,919
media go and back test until you can't

604
00:33:32,919 --> 00:33:35,399
unsee

605
00:33:35,399 --> 00:33:38,080
it some people be like yeah you you

606
00:33:38,080 --> 00:33:40,480
can't unsee it so how do you see it and

607
00:33:40,480 --> 00:33:45,080
still get your stop loss ran how how do

608
00:33:45,080 --> 00:33:48,880
you see it and still get cooked you know

609
00:33:48,880 --> 00:33:50,639
where all the liquidity is you don't

610
00:33:50,639 --> 00:33:53,600
know where to put your stop

611
00:33:54,240 --> 00:33:56,720
loss something is

612
00:33:56,720 --> 00:33:59,720
wrong

613
00:34:04,880 --> 00:34:08,520
so that's just letting y'all know

614
00:34:08,520 --> 00:34:11,159
that it's not any of the concepts that's

615
00:34:11,159 --> 00:34:13,159
out there it's not the mentorship it's

616
00:34:13,159 --> 00:34:15,480
not the

617
00:34:16,639 --> 00:34:19,719
teacher it's your ability to create a

618
00:34:19,719 --> 00:34:22,079
plan and follow it and you blame

619
00:34:22,079 --> 00:34:25,359
everything and everyone else but you

620
00:34:25,359 --> 00:34:28,679
take accountability for it

621
00:34:28,679 --> 00:34:31,918
you trading every new thing you see oh

622
00:34:31,918 --> 00:34:33,359
my gosh he took that entry and made

623
00:34:33,359 --> 00:34:35,000
money on it I'mma take it the next time

624
00:34:35,000 --> 00:34:39,919
I see it what kind of foolishness is

625
00:34:40,480 --> 00:34:44,079
that chasing

626
00:34:44,079 --> 00:34:48,079
everything but your actual

627
00:34:49,280 --> 00:34:53,480
plan you got to do something about

628
00:34:53,960 --> 00:34:56,399
that cuz soon enough life is going to

629
00:34:56,399 --> 00:34:59,440
Margin Call you

630
00:34:59,440 --> 00:35:00,960
and what would you have done with all of

631
00:35:00,960 --> 00:35:03,200
that time you

632
00:35:03,200 --> 00:35:07,680
had just yelling and screaming at other

633
00:35:08,480 --> 00:35:10,560
people telling other people what they

634
00:35:10,560 --> 00:35:12,359
were and what they wasn't until life

635
00:35:12,359 --> 00:35:14,000
squeezed you and now you over here

636
00:35:14,000 --> 00:35:17,040
having suicidal

637
00:35:17,240 --> 00:35:21,880
ideations I just wish I wasn't living

638
00:35:21,880 --> 00:35:25,320
anymore because you lack purpose and why

639
00:35:25,320 --> 00:35:27,359
do you lack purpose because you can't

640
00:35:27,359 --> 00:35:29,240
even

641
00:35:29,240 --> 00:35:32,480
follow or complete whatever it is you

642
00:35:32,480 --> 00:35:35,160
set out to do you have to keep jumping

643
00:35:35,160 --> 00:35:37,839
from thing to thing to thing until life

644
00:35:37,839 --> 00:35:40,599
catches up to you it catches up to

645
00:35:40,599 --> 00:35:43,119
everybody you know how many 50 year olds

646
00:35:43,119 --> 00:35:47,040
I know working as a cashier at

647
00:35:47,040 --> 00:35:49,560
7-Eleven and all they have to show for

648
00:35:49,560 --> 00:35:53,000
their life is pictures of when times

649
00:35:53,000 --> 00:35:54,079
were

650
00:35:54,079 --> 00:35:56,880
good while they argue about the way

651
00:35:56,880 --> 00:35:59,960
things are now now and how the young the

652
00:35:59,960 --> 00:36:03,960
young people don't know what they got

653
00:36:03,960 --> 00:36:07,599
they don't they are so

654
00:36:10,839 --> 00:36:13,480
ungrateful when it's them okay yeah we

655
00:36:13,480 --> 00:36:14,760
don't know what we got right it was

656
00:36:14,760 --> 00:36:17,720
harder for you right now it's easier for

657
00:36:17,720 --> 00:36:20,400
us that you can't take part in that wine

658
00:36:20,400 --> 00:36:23,400
you stuck

659
00:36:23,440 --> 00:36:26,560
there but blaming the young

660
00:36:26,560 --> 00:36:29,560
people

661
00:36:29,720 --> 00:36:32,240
that will be your life in a few

662
00:36:32,240 --> 00:36:35,560
years if you don't get it

663
00:36:35,560 --> 00:36:37,599
right

664
00:36:37,599 --> 00:36:40,319
so me take this away that that's that's

665
00:36:40,319 --> 00:36:43,119
just about all all the concepts that's

666
00:36:43,119 --> 00:36:45,760
there and why y'all shouldn't be arguing

667
00:36:45,760 --> 00:36:47,280
especially with people who make money

668
00:36:47,280 --> 00:36:49,319
when you

669
00:36:49,319 --> 00:36:52,200
don't

670
00:36:52,200 --> 00:36:55,560
right so what do we have

671
00:36:55,560 --> 00:36:59,520

high but in terms of

676
00:37:18,760 --> 00:37:22,680
structure we get here to there right

677
00:37:22,680 --> 00:37:25,760
this low we this High We traded below

678
00:37:25,760 --> 00:37:27,400

manipulation

688
00:37:58,960 --> 00:38:02,000
right into the

689
00:38:02,000 --> 00:38:04,560

717
00:39:36,480 --> 00:39:39,319
day it's you that's supposed to wait for

718
00:39:39,319 --> 00:39:42,200

00:39:57,960 --> 00:40:00,319
Z for

725
00:40:00,319 --> 00:40:03,079

00:40:03,079 --> 00:40:05,640
down there too tap through there and

727
00:40:05,640 --> 00:40:08,400
then

728
00:40:08,720 --> 00:40:11,680
higher and the little DTF X you know

729
00:40:11,680 --> 00:40:12,920
down here

730
00:40:12,920 --> 00:40:16,839
50% the down move you see his trade up

731
00:40:16,839 --> 00:40:19,280
above

732
00:40:19,599 --> 00:40:22,480
there they call like the inart Zone what

733
00:40:22,480 --> 00:40:24,560
what is it again m

734
00:40:24,560 --> 00:40:28,240
m something like that

735
00:40:28,240 --> 00:40:30,599
some guy infatuated with my Concepts and

736
00:40:30,599 --> 00:40:34,280
just re renaming them is that ad to the

737
00:40:34,280 --> 00:40:36,520
demand

738
00:40:36,520 --> 00:40:42,280
beow is there everything is

739
00:40:42,839 --> 00:40:46,160
there but

740
00:40:47,480 --> 00:40:52,680
you you had to be a part of this candle

741
00:40:52,680 --> 00:40:56,119
that you believed was going down because

742
00:40:56,119 --> 00:41:01,160
Joe Biden is an embarrassment to the

743
00:41:01,200 --> 00:41:05,119
country and then the the sell sign

744
00:41:05,119 --> 00:41:07,880
boys oh they placed that equal load

745
00:41:07,880 --> 00:41:11,359
there they placed that equal

746
00:41:11,359 --> 00:41:14,560
load to run it manipulated to something

747
00:41:14,560 --> 00:41:17,000
lower and that in that trade so we want

748
00:41:17,000 --> 00:41:20,520
Target the equal low at the Kill Zone

749
00:41:20,520 --> 00:41:23,800
and then it go from the Kill Zone to

750
00:41:23,800 --> 00:41:24,920
kill

751
00:41:24,920 --> 00:41:29,240
me take everything from me

752
00:41:32,800 --> 00:41:34,839
and again my man profitable loses in

753
00:41:34,839 --> 00:41:37,640
here but you guys can go and and and

754
00:41:37,640 --> 00:41:39,560
learn his stuff on his own I made a

755
00:41:39,560 --> 00:41:41,359
promise that I would not teach his

756
00:41:41,359 --> 00:41:45,520
things you going learn from the man

757
00:41:46,040 --> 00:41:50,920
himself all in there but

758
00:41:54,480 --> 00:41:56,720
you yeah you you could you could make

759
00:41:56,720 --> 00:41:59,359
the case for that ell way W off all that

760
00:41:59,359 --> 00:42:01,000
other yeah of

761
00:42:01,000 --> 00:42:03,480
course you can make the case for that

762
00:42:03,480 --> 00:42:05,599
the spring retest of the spring whatever

763
00:42:05,599 --> 00:42:07,000
you want you can make the case for all

764
00:42:07,000 --> 00:42:09,160
of

765
00:42:10,119 --> 00:42:12,359
that somebody else took a short out of

766
00:42:12,359 --> 00:42:15,760
the 50% of the imbalance over

767
00:42:15,760 --> 00:42:17,839
here and they got a short for not

768
00:42:17,839 --> 00:42:19,520
imbalance going going into that

769
00:42:19,520 --> 00:42:21,960
direction

770
00:42:22,440 --> 00:42:25,559
there and they their reasoning was

771
00:42:25,559 --> 00:42:28,079
taking this low rebalancing to an fug

772
00:42:28,079 --> 00:42:30,920
right taking this High rebalancing into

773
00:42:30,920 --> 00:42:32,319
FG

774
00:42:32,319 --> 00:42:36,599
below all of it is

775
00:42:37,640 --> 00:42:39,240
there

776
00:42:39,240 --> 00:42:42,599
again but

777
00:42:44,760 --> 00:42:48,760
you so time to make some

778
00:42:50,640 --> 00:42:52,400
changes trying to do something

779
00:42:52,400 --> 00:42:55,800
differently pick a concept stick to

780
00:42:55,800 --> 00:42:59,119
it pick a concept stick to

781
00:42:59,119 --> 00:43:01,480
it I don't tell people you have to trade

782
00:43:01,480 --> 00:43:03,680

783
00:43:03,680 --> 00:43:06,480
icts if you're going to trade ICT stick

784
00:43:06,480 --> 00:43:08,760

group you know I was talking with um uh

863
00:48:32,240 --> 00:48:35,000
the premium tier earlier today about

864
00:48:35,000 --> 00:48:38,760
these same things and it's it's the same

865
00:48:38,760 --> 00:48:42,040
thing with you know

866
00:48:42,040 --> 00:48:44,880
um anybody else that I would I would

867
00:48:44,880 --> 00:48:47,680
give any advice to I'm not telling you

868
00:48:47,680 --> 00:48:50,359
guys to ditch anybody else's Concepts

869
00:48:50,359 --> 00:48:52,359
I'm saying find the one that resonates

870
00:48:52,359 --> 00:48:54,920
with your personality find the one that

871
00:48:54,920 --> 00:48:58,000
resonates with your circumstance

872
00:48:58,000 --> 00:48:59,559
some people may not be able to trade to

873
00:48:59,559 --> 00:49:01,839
one minute because they only have a

874
00:49:01,839 --> 00:49:06,760
limited time at work so go up a time

875
00:49:06,760 --> 00:49:10,200
frame you know like there there are so

876
00:49:10,200 --> 00:49:12,559
many things that that you can do to

877
00:49:12,559 --> 00:49:15,760
change your circumstances little by

878
00:49:15,760 --> 00:49:18,160
little little by little

879
00:49:18,160 --> 00:49:21,280
matters because when you're moving

880
00:49:21,280 --> 00:49:24,240
things little by little it it builds and

881
00:49:24,240 --> 00:49:25,720
Blossoms

882
00:49:25,720 --> 00:49:29,119
into something

883
00:49:29,119 --> 00:49:33,000
larger something larger than

884
00:49:34,160 --> 00:49:38,920
that house is it starts with with

885
00:49:38,920 --> 00:49:42,520
what digging the

886
00:49:42,839 --> 00:49:45,920
ground you got to take that shovel and

887
00:49:45,920 --> 00:49:50,880
and dig that first part of the dirt

888
00:49:51,559 --> 00:49:54,760
out it starts with cleaning it out right

889
00:49:54,760 --> 00:49:56,720
clearing it out right they don't just

890
00:49:56,720 --> 00:49:58,200
put it on top of

891
00:49:58,200 --> 00:50:02,720
a a flat surface with no

892
00:50:02,720 --> 00:50:05,520
foundation so the very first part of

893
00:50:05,520 --> 00:50:09,160
found of building a foundation is

894
00:50:09,160 --> 00:50:13,960
what cleaning you out that means that

895
00:50:13,960 --> 00:50:16,520
undisciplined nature you have we all

896
00:50:16,520 --> 00:50:20,680
have it we all deal with it I deal with

897
00:50:20,680 --> 00:50:23,240

901
00:50:29,680 --> 00:50:31,760

00:50:57,720 --> 00:51:01,880
room as him DJ Dave but anytime I allow

912
00:51:01,880 --> 00:51:05,760
him to take over the minute I look

913
00:51:05,760 --> 00:51:09,119
up I can't even recognize what

914
00:51:09,119 --> 00:51:12,480
occurred who did

915
00:51:12,480 --> 00:51:15,040
this who was responsible for this that

916
00:51:15,040 --> 00:51:16,760
was that other side that I have to

917
00:51:16,760 --> 00:51:19,520
continue to keep down by what following

918
00:51:19,520 --> 00:51:20,440
my

919
00:51:20,440 --> 00:51:23,280
rules following my rules the rules that

920
00:51:23,280 --> 00:51:25,559
are in my trading plan and if I don't

921
00:51:25,559 --> 00:51:27,610
have a trading plan

922
00:51:27,610 --> 00:51:28,960
[Music]

923
00:51:28,960 --> 00:51:31,359
then

924
00:51:31,359 --> 00:51:33,559
yeah that's one of the biggest issues

925
00:51:33,559 --> 00:51:35,359
that people

926
00:51:35,359 --> 00:51:39,160
have when you don't have a trading plan

927
00:51:39,160 --> 00:51:41,319
that's how you get

928
00:51:41,319 --> 00:51:45,040
cooked you need a

929
00:51:45,160 --> 00:51:49,319
plan and if that plan doesn't

930
00:51:49,319 --> 00:51:52,000
work or it doesn't work as much as you

931
00:51:52,000 --> 00:51:54,799
like it to doesn't show enough

932
00:51:54,799 --> 00:51:57,480
opportunities then find some

933
00:51:57,480 --> 00:52:00,520
else that gives more opportunities some

934
00:52:00,520 --> 00:52:04,079
models give more opportunities than

935
00:52:04,240 --> 00:52:07,319
others that's the truth of the

936
00:52:07,319 --> 00:52:09,440
matter some models give far more

937
00:52:09,440 --> 00:52:12,400
opportunities than others

938
00:52:12,880 --> 00:52:15,280
do and once you start to understand that

939
00:52:15,280 --> 00:52:17,720
and recognize that

940
00:52:17,720 --> 00:52:20,760
then you're on the way to refining a

941
00:52:20,760 --> 00:52:23,440
plan or creating a plan

942
00:52:23,440 --> 00:52:27,079
that can change things for you but it's

943
00:52:27,079 --> 00:52:29,400
never going to be about the mentor the

944
00:52:29,400 --> 00:52:31,319
person that's teaching

945
00:52:31,319 --> 00:52:33,720
you the person can teach it until they

946
00:52:33,720 --> 00:52:35,400
tongue turn

947
00:52:35,400 --> 00:52:38,520
blue they could say every single word

948
00:52:38,520 --> 00:52:42,240
10,000 times to

949
00:52:42,520 --> 00:52:45,079
you and none of that will have any

950
00:52:45,079 --> 00:52:48,400
benefit if you don't put in the time if

951
00:52:48,400 --> 00:52:51,839
you don't put in the work towards

952
00:52:51,839 --> 00:52:54,440
it

953
00:52:54,440 --> 00:52:57,920
so I hope you guys enjoyed this

954
00:52:57,920 --> 00:53:02,880
uh uh earlier segment of of

955
00:53:02,880 --> 00:53:06,200
trading and

956
00:53:06,200 --> 00:53:10,559
um um I hope you guys rewatch this I

957
00:53:10,559 --> 00:53:14,319
think this is very important you know to

958
00:53:14,319 --> 00:53:17,359
this this is psychology this is trading

959
00:53:17,359 --> 00:53:20,119
psychology trading psychology is not go

960
00:53:20,119 --> 00:53:21,920
for a cold

961
00:53:21,920 --> 00:53:25,440
plunge meditate before you get into your

962
00:53:25,440 --> 00:53:28,280
entry

963
00:53:28,280 --> 00:53:31,440
trade and psychology is Define rules and

964
00:53:31,440 --> 00:53:35,720
follow it and if following it causes you

965
00:53:35,720 --> 00:53:38,000
to lose more than you

966
00:53:38,000 --> 00:53:41,559
win create better

967
00:53:42,440 --> 00:53:45,680
rules but if you're not following the

968
00:53:45,680 --> 00:53:48,520
rules that are in your trading plan you

969
00:53:48,520 --> 00:53:50,559
can never say a particular concept

970
00:53:50,559 --> 00:53:52,160
doesn't

971
00:53:52,160 --> 00:53:55,440
work you can never say

972
00:53:55,440 --> 00:53:57,000
that

973
00:53:57,000 --> 00:54:01,280
you can never say something does not

974
00:54:01,280 --> 00:54:03,839
work if you won't even put in the time

975
00:54:03,839 --> 00:54:06,040
for

976
00:54:06,119 --> 00:54:08,720
it you tried it out a couple of times

977
00:54:08,720 --> 00:54:10,799
and it worked a little bit and then

978
00:54:10,799 --> 00:54:12,640
other times it didn't and now you just

979
00:54:12,640 --> 00:54:14,440
gave up on it that's you that's not the

980
00:54:14,440 --> 00:54:16,920
concept that's

981
00:54:16,920 --> 00:54:20,240
you it's

982
00:54:23,920 --> 00:54:28,240
you um Dave can you elaborate more on a

983
00:54:28,240 --> 00:54:32,160
trading plan what entails it just want

984
00:54:32,160 --> 00:54:34,599
some insight I have heard plan many

985
00:54:34,599 --> 00:54:37,400
times but I don't understand what it is

986
00:54:37,400 --> 00:54:40,319
exactly well it sounds like you have no

987
00:54:40,319 --> 00:54:42,880
strategy because a trading plan is

988
00:54:42,880 --> 00:54:46,559
within whatever strategy you've created

989
00:54:46,559 --> 00:54:49,920
from whatever Concepts you

990
00:54:49,920 --> 00:54:53,440
use that's that's what a trading plan

991
00:54:53,440 --> 00:54:57,839
is so for the guys who trade

992
00:54:57,839 --> 00:54:59,640
support and

993
00:54:59,640 --> 00:55:01,599
resistance let's say they were going to

994
00:55:01,599 --> 00:55:04,599
take something like this

995
00:55:04,599 --> 00:55:08,520
right their concept is if we break up

996
00:55:08,520 --> 00:55:13,200
above here and close and retest on it

997
00:55:13,200 --> 00:55:15,680
right they'll be taking that entry that

998
00:55:15,680 --> 00:55:19,440
way but if we break up above here and we

999
00:55:19,440 --> 00:55:22,480
close below here they'll be taking the

1000
00:55:22,480 --> 00:55:26,839
retest to go lower that is

1001
00:55:26,839 --> 00:55:29,680
their trading plan according to what

1002
00:55:29,680 --> 00:55:31,599
occurs

1003
00:55:31,599 --> 00:55:34,440
here according to the strategy or the

1004
00:55:34,440 --> 00:55:36,960
concept that they follow so for you to

1005
00:55:36,960 --> 00:55:39,039
have no plan at all you don't even have

1006
00:55:39,039 --> 00:55:39,880
a

1007
00:55:39,880 --> 00:55:43,960
strategy you need the concepts back

1008
00:55:43,960 --> 00:55:47,520
tested along with how it works out the

1009
00:55:47,520 --> 00:55:50,680
win rate if you follow it mechanically

1010
00:55:50,680 --> 00:55:53,000
you need that first and then you need to

1011
00:55:53,000 --> 00:55:55,960
develop rules around it so oh there are

1012
00:55:55,960 --> 00:55:58,240
times where I see it break above here

1013
00:55:58,240 --> 00:56:00,440
but it's it's with a wick instead of

1014
00:56:00,440 --> 00:56:02,799
giving a body so I'm not going to take

1015
00:56:02,799 --> 00:56:05,599
one until they give a body above

1016
00:56:05,599 --> 00:56:08,319
there I'm not going to take one until

1017
00:56:08,319 --> 00:56:10,319
you see how Tor trades talked about

1018
00:56:10,319 --> 00:56:13,000
having the the trend line my rules are

1019
00:56:13,000 --> 00:56:15,480
this what you said my rules are three

1020
00:56:15,480 --> 00:56:18,240
touches to the trend line there three

1021
00:56:18,240 --> 00:56:19,760
touches that's you hear I say that in

1022
00:56:19,760 --> 00:56:23,760
every video three touches to those are

1023
00:56:23,760 --> 00:56:26,960
rules now I don't trade trend lines and

1024
00:56:26,960 --> 00:56:28,960
and that's what I used to trade and I no

1025
00:56:28,960 --> 00:56:31,079
longer use them because I have a more

1026
00:56:31,079 --> 00:56:34,319
refined way of engaging in the market

1027
00:56:34,319 --> 00:56:40,280
but even those have rules so you need a

1028
00:56:40,280 --> 00:56:42,760
strategy

1029
00:56:42,760 --> 00:56:46,039
first you need to learn a certain set of

1030
00:56:46,039 --> 00:56:48,440
Concepts that happen over and over and

1031
00:56:48,440 --> 00:56:50,440
over and over and over and over and over

1032
00:56:50,440 --> 00:56:53,799
and over and over and over and over

1033
00:56:53,799 --> 00:56:56,000
again Dave are you going to mention M

1034
00:56:56,000 --> 00:56:57,839
effect the creative the concepts you

1035
00:56:57,839 --> 00:57:01,079
using or you waiting to get cheated on

1036
00:57:01,079 --> 00:57:04,359
after buying a

1037
00:57:04,359 --> 00:57:06,400
batch I I don't even know what you're

1038
00:57:06,400 --> 00:57:08,960
saying but um men of X created supply

1039
00:57:08,960 --> 00:57:11,079
and demand the only thing I learned from

1040
00:57:11,079 --> 00:57:14,240
M of X was uh uh

1041
00:57:14,240 --> 00:57:17,799
wof which that's in the bio or the

1042
00:57:17,799 --> 00:57:21,359
description of my course here on YouTube

1043
00:57:21,359 --> 00:57:23,440
credited to

1044
00:57:23,440 --> 00:57:26,720
him so if you want to look at the other

1045
00:57:26,720 --> 00:57:29,440
things I learned go and look at Pips of

1046
00:57:29,440 --> 00:57:31,960
Persia who men effect effects also

1047
00:57:31,960 --> 00:57:36,240
learned from and with men effect the

1048
00:57:36,240 --> 00:57:39,599
same guy his whim rate is a

1049
00:57:39,599 --> 00:57:42,160
30% when I joined his group for one

1050
00:57:42,160 --> 00:57:44,640
month I said there's no way my kids need

1051
00:57:44,640 --> 00:57:48,960
to eat 30% of the time so unfortunately

1052
00:57:48,960 --> 00:57:52,599
I cannot follow this one month and one

1053
00:57:52,599 --> 00:57:53,799
month

1054
00:57:53,799 --> 00:57:56,640
alone but that makes it his content

1055
00:57:56,640 --> 00:57:58,880
right right and just invalidates

1056
00:57:58,880 --> 00:58:01,559
everything else and makes it his right

1057
00:58:01,559 --> 00:58:04,160
foolish

1058
00:58:05,319 --> 00:58:10,680
people so you know with with uh

1059
00:58:10,680 --> 00:58:14,440
uh with with little things you know like

1060
00:58:14,440 --> 00:58:16,680
like your trading plan you have to be

1061
00:58:16,680 --> 00:58:19,960
sure that it's rooted in Concepts that

1062
00:58:19,960 --> 00:58:23,920
you see work out more times than they

1063
00:58:23,920 --> 00:58:27,839
don't more times than they do

1064
00:58:27,839 --> 00:58:32,440
not so a 30% wiim rate

1065
00:58:32,440 --> 00:58:34,400
terrible that's not something that's

1066
00:58:34,400 --> 00:58:36,640
going to change your life that's not

1067
00:58:36,640 --> 00:58:38,480
something that's going to feed your

1068
00:58:38,480 --> 00:58:42,280
family especially if you need to be a

1069
00:58:42,280 --> 00:58:45,559
scalper because you're not provided with

1070
00:58:45,559 --> 00:58:48,160
the opportunity of being able to take

1071
00:58:48,160 --> 00:58:51,280
one trade from a weekly time frame see

1072
00:58:51,280 --> 00:58:52,799
that through you don't have enough money

1073
00:58:52,799 --> 00:58:54,559
to swing trade that's where big money is

1074
00:58:54,559 --> 00:58:56,680
Swing trading not in is scalping

1075
00:58:56,680 --> 00:58:58,720
scalping is the fastest way to

1076
00:58:58,720 --> 00:59:03,880
wealth the fastest way to wealth is to

1077
00:59:03,880 --> 00:59:07,160
scalp so if you need to be a scalper

1078
00:59:07,160 --> 00:59:10,799
anything below a 50% win rate will take

1079
00:59:10,799 --> 00:59:14,640
away from your mental Capital it will

1080
00:59:14,640 --> 00:59:18,039
destroy your mental

1081
00:59:18,039 --> 00:59:20,240
Capital

1082
00:59:20,240 --> 00:59:25,039
anything below a 50% win rate will

1083
00:59:25,039 --> 00:59:29,200
destroy your mental

1084
00:59:29,200 --> 00:59:33,000
capital and because of that you have to

1085
00:59:33,000 --> 00:59:35,520
find Concepts you have to find

1086
00:59:35,520 --> 00:59:38,760
strategies that work far more than 50%

1087
00:59:38,760 --> 00:59:41,079
of the

1088
00:59:41,160 --> 00:59:45,599
time far more than 50% of the

1089
00:59:46,760 --> 00:59:48,920
time

1090
00:59:48,920 --> 00:59:52,559
so um with that trade plan question you

1091
00:59:52,559 --> 00:59:55,039
actually need to do more

1092
00:59:55,039 --> 00:59:57,480
learning and that's the only way that

1093
00:59:57,480 --> 00:59:59,280
that you're going to have a plan that

1094
00:59:59,280 --> 01:00:00,520
you

1095
01:00:00,520 --> 01:00:03,520
know that uh works for you nothing else

1096
01:00:03,520 --> 01:00:06,559
is going to work for

1097
01:00:08,280 --> 01:00:11,440
you um I'm sure lots of people have

1098
01:00:11,440 --> 01:00:13,359
knowledge on the market for me been

1099
01:00:13,359 --> 01:00:16,520
searching for a mentor trading Guru to

1100
01:00:16,520 --> 01:00:19,880
learn from for two and a half years no

1101
01:00:19,880 --> 01:00:22,119
one has come close to Dave teachings hey

1102
01:00:22,119 --> 01:00:24,200
hey but I mean you you can find any

1103
01:00:24,200 --> 01:00:25,720
teachers that are out there that that

1104
01:00:25,720 --> 01:00:28,799
are amazing in in in their own right you

1105
01:00:28,799 --> 01:00:31,720
just have to make sure that the stuff

1106
01:00:31,720 --> 01:00:35,280
that they teach they actually trade it I

1107
01:00:35,280 --> 01:00:38,240
don't teach ICT because I don't trade

1108
01:00:38,240 --> 01:00:41,440
ICT I don't teach W off because I don't

1109
01:00:41,440 --> 01:00:44,880
trade W off I don't teach Elliot wave

1110
01:00:44,880 --> 01:00:47,640
because I don't trade Elliot wave you

1111
01:00:47,640 --> 01:00:49,160
get what I'm

1112
01:00:49,160 --> 01:00:53,480
saying so if I teach you that price

1113
01:00:53,480 --> 01:00:55,480
takes a high trades back into the

1114
01:00:55,480 --> 01:00:57,799
previous range and trades higher or

1115
01:00:57,799 --> 01:00:59,920
price price takes a low trades back into

1116
01:00:59,920 --> 01:01:02,319
the prev previous range and trades lower

1117
01:01:02,319 --> 01:01:05,000
if I'm T if I'm saying take a oneto one

1118
01:01:05,000 --> 01:01:08,480
from a Zone it's because I am using it

1119
01:01:08,480 --> 01:01:10,119
to make

1120
01:01:10,119 --> 01:01:13,599
money I will not ever teach you anything

1121
01:01:13,599 --> 01:01:18,000
that I don't use myself that's called

1122
01:01:18,000 --> 01:01:21,240
unqualified teaching how can I teach you

1123
01:01:21,240 --> 01:01:23,799
something I have no experience with how

1124
01:01:23,799 --> 01:01:26,359
can I teach you something I do not use

1125
01:01:26,359 --> 01:01:28,920
every day but expect you to benefit

1126
01:01:28,920 --> 01:01:32,200
from I

1127
01:01:33,000 --> 01:01:36,240
can't you

1128
01:01:36,720 --> 01:01:39,039
can't so make sure the person that you

1129
01:01:39,039 --> 01:01:40,359
are learning

1130
01:01:40,359 --> 01:01:43,640
from right person that you're learning

1131
01:01:43,640 --> 01:01:46,440
from they're also trading what they

1132
01:01:46,440 --> 01:01:48,280
teach that's why I point out people like

1133
01:01:48,280 --> 01:01:50,599
dodgy I point out people like profitable

1134
01:01:50,599 --> 01:01:53,200
loser I point out people like like uh uh

1135
01:01:53,200 --> 01:01:56,039
Pepe I point out people like stoic stoic

1136
01:01:56,039 --> 01:01:59,079
takes a portion of what I

1137
01:01:59,079 --> 01:02:02,240
teach and sees it in his own way and

1138
01:02:02,240 --> 01:02:05,720
uses it his own way some of his entries

1139
01:02:05,720 --> 01:02:07,720
are not the same entries I

1140
01:02:07,720 --> 01:02:11,559
take Charles look at the way he trades I

1141
01:02:11,559 --> 01:02:13,319
don't trade the way Charles trades but

1142
01:02:13,319 --> 01:02:15,559
he trades within what I've taught and he

1143
01:02:15,559 --> 01:02:19,240
utilizes it in his own

1144
01:02:21,640 --> 01:02:24,200
way so everybody's going to learn

1145
01:02:24,200 --> 01:02:27,920
something from somebody and be able to

1146
01:02:27,920 --> 01:02:29,000
tweak

1147
01:02:29,000 --> 01:02:33,640
it and be able to change it and see it

1148
01:02:33,640 --> 01:02:38,160
every day and be able to depend on it on

1149
01:02:38,160 --> 01:02:40,480
their own without the other person the

1150
01:02:40,480 --> 01:02:43,520
whole point of learning is to stabilize

1151
01:02:43,520 --> 01:02:45,319
your approach to what you see in the

1152
01:02:45,319 --> 01:02:48,799
market and then take what you see in the

1153
01:02:48,799 --> 01:02:52,480
market right and find a way to get

1154
01:02:52,480 --> 01:02:55,039
involved with it some of y'all want to

1155
01:02:55,039 --> 01:02:58,559
see ICT entries but he already showed so

1156
01:02:58,559 --> 01:03:02,079
many things that you can take to trade

1157
01:03:02,079 --> 01:03:05,440
with he already showed so many different

1158
01:03:05,440 --> 01:03:07,880
you know styles of price action that you

1159
01:03:07,880 --> 01:03:10,559
can read yourself

1160
01:03:10,559 --> 01:03:14,680
right invine entries with

1161
01:03:14,799 --> 01:03:18,960
it so it's not up to him to show every

1162
01:03:18,960 --> 01:03:21,240
single entry it's not up to dodgy to

1163
01:03:21,240 --> 01:03:24,119
show every single entry he would take

1164
01:03:24,119 --> 01:03:26,160
it's not up to him to confirm that you

1165
01:03:26,160 --> 01:03:29,079
should take an entry it's up to you to

1166
01:03:29,079 --> 01:03:32,559
learn what it is that they do how it is

1167
01:03:32,559 --> 01:03:34,079
that they see the market and then

1168
01:03:34,079 --> 01:03:37,079
develop your own sight for

1169
01:03:37,079 --> 01:03:39,359
it that's what you got to do develop

1170
01:03:39,359 --> 01:03:41,279
your own sight for

1171
01:03:41,279 --> 01:03:43,680
it and that's literally what I teach

1172
01:03:43,680 --> 01:03:46,599
other people just do

1173
01:03:46,599 --> 01:03:49,319
that just do

1174
01:03:49,319 --> 01:03:51,559
that and that's the fastest way to

1175
01:03:51,559 --> 01:03:54,920
become profitable developing your own

1176
01:03:54,920 --> 01:03:56,880
Edge in the market

1177
01:03:56,880 --> 01:04:00,599
Market your own

1178
01:04:01,799 --> 01:04:03,720
Edge so

1179
01:04:03,720 --> 01:04:08,079
um I hope that that uh answers the the

1180
01:04:08,079 --> 01:04:09,240
question for

1181
01:04:09,240 --> 01:04:11,559
you uh should we be paper trading or

1182
01:04:11,559 --> 01:04:14,319
just read and price or both um I feel

1183
01:04:14,319 --> 01:04:17,400
like I'm left behind with the

1184
01:04:17,400 --> 01:04:20,240
group uh and without being able to

1185
01:04:20,240 --> 01:04:23,240
finish the playlist uh let me see feel

1186
01:04:23,240 --> 01:04:26,640
even more lost any recommendations so

1187
01:04:26,640 --> 01:04:29,279
if if I teach you structure as the first

1188
01:04:29,279 --> 01:04:30,839
thing that you need to

1189
01:04:30,839 --> 01:04:33,720
learn then you need to back test the

1190
01:04:33,720 --> 01:04:36,680
hell out of structure and it needs to be

1191
01:04:36,680 --> 01:04:40,079
the only thing that you are taking an

1192
01:04:40,079 --> 01:04:42,559
entry on is structure you're going to

1193
01:04:42,559 --> 01:04:44,559
see times where it does not hold you're

1194
01:04:44,559 --> 01:04:46,440
going to see times where it does hold

1195
01:04:46,440 --> 01:04:48,319
that's going to add to your experience

1196
01:04:48,319 --> 01:04:50,599
of when to use it and when not to use it

1197
01:04:50,599 --> 01:04:52,079
but you need to back test the hell out

1198
01:04:52,079 --> 01:04:53,000
of

1199
01:04:53,000 --> 01:04:56,359
that and then when I go into orderflow

1200
01:04:56,359 --> 01:04:57,440
and

1201
01:04:57,440 --> 01:05:00,799
narrative then now use orderflow and

1202
01:05:00,799 --> 01:05:02,599
narrative and back test the hell out of

1203
01:05:02,599 --> 01:05:05,200
that and then when I go into teaching

1204
01:05:05,200 --> 01:05:08,920
you about zones now you need to back

1205
01:05:08,920 --> 01:05:11,960
test zones and become proficient in

1206
01:05:11,960 --> 01:05:13,400
utilizing

1207
01:05:13,400 --> 01:05:16,000
zones and then when I go into you so you

1208
01:05:16,000 --> 01:05:17,799
you kind of get what I'm saying you move

1209
01:05:17,799 --> 01:05:20,640
from one thing to the next thing to the

1210
01:05:20,640 --> 01:05:23,440
next thing to the next thing to the next

1211
01:05:23,440 --> 01:05:25,319
thing to the next thing you don't try to

1212
01:05:25,319 --> 01:05:27,680
throw it all together because that's how

1213
01:05:27,680 --> 01:05:29,079
you run yourself

1214
01:05:29,079 --> 01:05:33,440
crazy you never try to throw it all

1215
01:05:33,440 --> 01:05:35,880
together you have to get good with one

1216
01:05:35,880 --> 01:05:37,920
thing and move to the next get good with

1217
01:05:37,920 --> 01:05:40,079
one thing move to the next get good with

1218
01:05:40,079 --> 01:05:42,240
one thing move to the next and soon

1219
01:05:42,240 --> 01:05:44,440
enough it all comes together and now

1220
01:05:44,440 --> 01:05:47,559
you're able to see the ones that align

1221
01:05:47,559 --> 01:05:48,520
with the

1222
01:05:48,520 --> 01:05:51,640
others and what's premium and what's not

1223
01:05:51,640 --> 01:05:55,079
what's your A+ setup and what's a setup

1224
01:05:55,079 --> 01:05:57,240
that you always see

1225
01:05:57,240 --> 01:06:00,839
fail so what did I tell you guys I said

1226
01:06:00,839 --> 01:06:03,680
to Trail your highs and lows right I

1227
01:06:03,680 --> 01:06:06,359
said to count your swings

1228
01:06:06,359 --> 01:06:09,200
right so that means if you're counting

1229
01:06:09,200 --> 01:06:12,440
your swings four to six swings in price

1230
01:06:12,440 --> 01:06:15,760
reverses right so that means by the time

1231
01:06:15,760 --> 01:06:17,359
we get to the fourth swing you're no

1232
01:06:17,359 --> 01:06:20,319
longer continuation

1233
01:06:20,319 --> 01:06:24,079
trading now you're stepping aside to see

1234
01:06:24,079 --> 01:06:26,520
okay he said for six swings in price

1235
01:06:26,520 --> 01:06:29,160
reverse let me step

1236
01:06:29,160 --> 01:06:31,680
out and watch to see what what it's

1237
01:06:31,680 --> 01:06:33,480
going to

1238
01:06:33,480 --> 01:06:37,359
do will it actually

1239
01:06:37,359 --> 01:06:39,039
reverse

1240
01:06:39,039 --> 01:06:42,880
or does it

1241
01:06:43,319 --> 01:06:46,559
continue that's one thing to

1242
01:06:46,559 --> 01:06:49,039
follow County of swings is equivalent to

1243
01:06:49,039 --> 01:06:51,440
trailing and highs and lows now you just

1244
01:06:51,440 --> 01:06:54,119
know how many highs and lows get

1245
01:06:54,119 --> 01:06:57,440
created before you begin to anticipate

1246
01:06:57,440 --> 01:06:58,279
price

1247
01:06:58,279 --> 01:07:01,319
reversing but you also know when to stay

1248
01:07:01,319 --> 01:07:03,960
out of continuation

1249
01:07:03,960 --> 01:07:07,279
trading so those those little things you

1250
01:07:07,279 --> 01:07:09,480
you sort of want to add to you don't

1251
01:07:09,480 --> 01:07:11,480
have to know all the stuff that that's

1252
01:07:11,480 --> 01:07:14,079
there you have to trade every single

1253
01:07:14,079 --> 01:07:16,279
concept that's that's

1254
01:07:16,279 --> 01:07:18,680
taught get good with one thing and move

1255
01:07:18,680 --> 01:07:22,039
to the next thing that's how you

1256
01:07:22,880 --> 01:07:25,279
refine absorb what is useful discard

1257
01:07:25,279 --> 01:07:29,760
what is not yes yes that's exactly it oh

1258
01:07:29,760 --> 01:07:33,680
you quot Bruce Lee you quot Bruce Lee

1259
01:07:33,680 --> 01:07:35,680
yeah that's exactly

1260
01:07:35,680 --> 01:07:39,200
it because you need to see it for

1261
01:07:39,200 --> 01:07:41,880
yourself no one else can do this for you

1262
01:07:41,880 --> 01:07:44,880
you need to see it for

1263
01:07:47,200 --> 01:07:49,880
yourself and that's how I approach every

1264
01:07:49,880 --> 01:07:52,000
day with trading that's how I approach

1265
01:07:52,000 --> 01:07:53,799
every day with you know talk about every

1266
01:07:53,799 --> 01:07:56,000
day is a profitable day every day is you

1267
01:07:56,000 --> 01:07:57,400
know trading day is a blessing to be on

1268
01:07:57,400 --> 01:07:59,039
the right side of the market every day

1269
01:07:59,039 --> 01:08:00,920
why am I saying the right side of the

1270
01:08:00,920 --> 01:08:02,680
market because all I'm doing is

1271
01:08:02,680 --> 01:08:04,880
following

1272
01:08:04,880 --> 01:08:07,240
structure most times structure will

1273
01:08:07,240 --> 01:08:08,720
remain

1274
01:08:08,720 --> 01:08:11,160
intact and the times where you can't

1275
01:08:11,160 --> 01:08:12,319
understand structure you need to know

1276
01:08:12,319 --> 01:08:13,640
that you're in a

1277
01:08:13,640 --> 01:08:16,560
Range if you have a high put

1278
01:08:16,560 --> 01:08:19,759
in and you put in a low and then you put

1279
01:08:19,759 --> 01:08:22,279
in another high after right let me show

1280
01:08:22,279 --> 01:08:24,198
you guys

1281
01:08:24,198 --> 01:08:26,640
this if you you have a high put in and

1282
01:08:26,640 --> 01:08:28,600
you put in a low and then you put in

1283
01:08:28,600 --> 01:08:31,880
another high after and you trade down to

1284
01:08:31,880 --> 01:08:33,600
here right and it fails to put in

1285
01:08:33,600 --> 01:08:35,679
another low and it goes back up here

1286
01:08:35,679 --> 01:08:37,040
right and it looks like it's going to

1287
01:08:37,040 --> 01:08:38,799
head back down that way and then it goes

1288
01:08:38,799 --> 01:08:40,679
back up here and it goes back down to

1289
01:08:40,679 --> 01:08:42,359
here and then back here and then back

1290
01:08:42,359 --> 01:08:44,520
there and then back there you need to

1291
01:08:44,520 --> 01:08:46,319
understand where your highs and lows are

1292
01:08:46,319 --> 01:08:47,839
where are your last highs and lows well

1293
01:08:47,839 --> 01:08:49,799
there's a low here there's a high here

1294
01:08:49,799 --> 01:08:51,439
there's a low here there's a high here

1295
01:08:51,439 --> 01:08:52,600
so

1296
01:08:52,600 --> 01:08:56,439
this and this is the last high and low

1297
01:08:56,439 --> 01:08:58,960
that we have if we have not put in a new

1298
01:08:58,960 --> 01:09:01,319
high neither have we put in a new low

1299
01:09:01,319 --> 01:09:04,920
we're in a Range we're

1300
01:09:05,000 --> 01:09:07,080
accumulating and you need to understand

1301
01:09:07,080 --> 01:09:09,040
that within accumulation price can come

1302
01:09:09,040 --> 01:09:11,080
out of any side of accumulation price

1303
01:09:11,080 --> 01:09:14,040
can dip below and then trade back up

1304
01:09:14,040 --> 01:09:17,880
above or price can trade up above and

1305
01:09:17,880 --> 01:09:19,560
then dip back

1306
01:09:19,560 --> 01:09:22,640
below but you need to understand when

1307
01:09:22,640 --> 01:09:25,560
you're in accumulation versus when when

1308
01:09:25,560 --> 01:09:27,679
you're in a trending

1309
01:09:27,679 --> 01:09:30,719
environment and it the the dead giveaway

1310
01:09:30,719 --> 01:09:35,399
is when we have the high and the low

1311
01:09:35,399 --> 01:09:37,319
that puts in a new high and we failed to

1312
01:09:37,319 --> 01:09:40,399
put in a new high or a new low you're in

1313
01:09:40,399 --> 01:09:41,880
a

1314
01:09:41,880 --> 01:09:45,238
Range so if that part begins to get a

1315
01:09:45,238 --> 01:09:49,359
little more difficult for you then you

1316
01:09:49,359 --> 01:09:51,319
need to know that that's where I step

1317
01:09:51,319 --> 01:09:54,560
out of the market and I wait until it's

1318
01:09:54,560 --> 01:09:56,640
clear for

1319
01:09:56,640 --> 01:10:00,080
me wait until it's clear for

1320
01:10:00,080 --> 01:10:02,679
me but some of you guys try to force

1321
01:10:02,679 --> 01:10:04,560
anything and everything you're always

1322
01:10:04,560 --> 01:10:07,239
forcing entries you need to take the

1323
01:10:07,239 --> 01:10:08,960
next setup you need to take this next

1324
01:10:08,960 --> 01:10:10,600
setup you need to take the next setup

1325
01:10:10,600 --> 01:10:12,360
you need to find another one you need to

1326
01:10:12,360 --> 01:10:14,199
find another and then you blame other

1327
01:10:14,199 --> 01:10:17,480
people for it oh what you teach doesn't

1328
01:10:17,480 --> 01:10:19,199
work no you don't

1329
01:10:19,199 --> 01:10:21,840
work that's what it is your discipline

1330
01:10:21,840 --> 01:10:24,040
doesn't work your ability to follow

1331
01:10:24,040 --> 01:10:26,480
instructions doesn't work

1332
01:10:26,480 --> 01:10:29,679
it's not the mentor it's

1333
01:10:29,679 --> 01:10:31,600
you and once you come to that

1334
01:10:31,600 --> 01:10:34,320
realization of that you know

1335
01:10:34,320 --> 01:10:37,120
just makes things a bit easier if I

1336
01:10:37,120 --> 01:10:39,840
follow the instructions and I follow the

1337
01:10:39,840 --> 01:10:41,800
rules

1338
01:10:41,800 --> 01:10:45,640
then I should be successful with it what

1339
01:10:45,640 --> 01:10:47,840
is the rules that the person that you're

1340
01:10:47,840 --> 01:10:52,040
learning from gave you what are the

1341
01:10:52,520 --> 01:10:54,719
rules if your Mentor doesn't clearly

1342
01:10:54,719 --> 01:10:57,719
Define rules TOS then find a new Mentor

1343
01:10:57,719 --> 01:10:59,520
they're just regurgitating Concepts but

1344
01:10:59,520 --> 01:11:01,239
can't tell you how to actually Trade It

1345
01:11:01,239 --> 01:11:03,719
find a new

1346
01:11:06,199 --> 01:11:09,199
Mentor

1347
01:11:11,440 --> 01:11:14,360
right or or y'all y'all just going

1348
01:11:14,360 --> 01:11:17,520
to slave and and Trauma bond with people

1349
01:11:17,520 --> 01:11:20,560
that's that's friendly to

1350
01:11:24,239 --> 01:11:26,530
you

1351
01:11:26,530 --> 01:11:28,520
[Music]

1353
01:11:31,280 --> 01:11:34,760
session you said when price forms uh I I

1354
01:11:34,760 --> 01:11:36,199
don't have any back tested sessions

1355
01:11:36,199 --> 01:11:38,880
publicly so I'm not answering what I do

1356
01:11:38,880 --> 01:11:42,520
in the me the mentorship uh

1357
01:11:42,520 --> 01:11:45,560
publicly um they already got all the

1358
01:11:45,560 --> 01:11:48,840
leaked videos they could use

1359
01:11:52,360 --> 01:11:54,239
that

1360
01:11:54,239 --> 01:11:56,639
uh

1361
01:11:56,639 --> 01:11:57,880
Dave can you please reopen your

1362
01:11:57,880 --> 01:12:01,159
mentorship program please um I would but

1363
01:12:01,159 --> 01:12:02,840
I I don't want to go against my rules

1364
01:12:02,840 --> 01:12:05,040
usually when I do reopen it for somebody

1365
01:12:05,040 --> 01:12:07,320
it's usually a Karen that I'm reopening

1366
01:12:07,320 --> 01:12:09,280
it for and it's usually like the worst

1367
01:12:09,280 --> 01:12:11,880
possible person that that I could you

1368
01:12:11,880 --> 01:12:15,719
know reopen it for I've learned so much

1369
01:12:15,719 --> 01:12:18,800
with within even just the openings and

1370
01:12:18,800 --> 01:12:20,840
who ends up being late with it and and

1371
01:12:20,840 --> 01:12:22,840
most times the people who are late to

1372
01:12:22,840 --> 01:12:25,679
the openings are not worth even

1373
01:12:25,679 --> 01:12:27,560
you know having in in the group they

1374
01:12:27,560 --> 01:12:29,480
were late already right they didn't

1375
01:12:29,480 --> 01:12:31,800
prioritize it now for the people who

1376
01:12:31,800 --> 01:12:33,560
missed it cool but for the people didn't

1377
01:12:33,560 --> 01:12:35,880
prioritize it it says a lot about them

1378
01:12:35,880 --> 01:12:40,480
already so um yeah no I I I got to wait

1379
01:12:40,480 --> 01:12:43,239
until the next opening I had one guy I I

1380
01:12:43,239 --> 01:12:46,199
opened it late for him and he was like I

1381
01:12:46,199 --> 01:12:48,760
don't like the way you chastise the

1382
01:12:48,760 --> 01:12:51,520
members when they don't follow

1383
01:12:51,520 --> 01:12:54,440
instructions okay you you said you're a

1384
01:12:54,440 --> 01:12:57,920
40y old dad with a wife and kids and

1385
01:12:57,920 --> 01:12:59,639
when they don't follow instructions what

1386
01:12:59,639 --> 01:13:03,239
do you do what do you tell your children

1387
01:13:03,239 --> 01:13:05,159
but you don't want someone else

1388
01:13:05,159 --> 01:13:09,360
reinforcing instructions on other people

1389
01:13:09,360 --> 01:13:12,719
okay we'll we'll see we'll see where you

1390
01:13:12,719 --> 01:13:15,560
go with this I have a rental property

1391
01:13:15,560 --> 01:13:17,760
and no you wouldn't be searching for a

1392
01:13:17,760 --> 01:13:21,000
group to learn how to trade if life was

1393
01:13:21,000 --> 01:13:23,199
going well for you nobody cares about

1394
01:13:23,199 --> 01:13:25,600
your rental property have you seen the

1395
01:13:25,600 --> 01:13:27,320
real estate

1396
01:13:27,320 --> 01:13:30,000
market have you seen where all of the

1397
01:13:30,000 --> 01:13:33,760
savings have gone around the

1398
01:13:34,000 --> 01:13:36,280
country

1399
01:13:36,280 --> 01:13:39,679
so I'm not buying a

1400
01:13:39,679 --> 01:13:42,520
joker usually the the people that I I

1401
01:13:42,520 --> 01:13:44,840
open it for is it's just it's always a

1402
01:13:44,840 --> 01:13:48,280
disaster so I'm just going to wait you

1403
01:13:48,280 --> 01:13:51,440
know for when I do open

1404
01:13:53,600 --> 01:13:57,040
it um

1405
01:14:02,159 --> 01:14:03,719
see one thing I appreciate about you DAV

1406
01:14:03,719 --> 01:14:05,400
is that you call us out in our

1407
01:14:05,400 --> 01:14:07,280
foolishness the way you do it isn't

1408
01:14:07,280 --> 01:14:09,480
everyone's cup of tea but nonetheless

1409
01:14:09,480 --> 01:14:12,320
it's necessary and I mean most people

1410
01:14:12,320 --> 01:14:13,960
are not going to see it as necessary

1411
01:14:13,960 --> 01:14:17,000
most people need you know someone around

1412
01:14:17,000 --> 01:14:19,199
that's palatable

1413
01:14:19,199 --> 01:14:22,239
to you know their their circumstances

1414
01:14:22,239 --> 01:14:23,960
you ever give a friend advice and your

1415
01:14:23,960 --> 01:14:25,560
friend is upset that you

1416
01:14:25,560 --> 01:14:28,440
you gave them a solution you care so

1417
01:14:28,440 --> 01:14:31,239
much about them that you gave a solution

1418
01:14:31,239 --> 01:14:34,000
to them on how to solve whatever it is

1419
01:14:34,000 --> 01:14:35,600
that they claim they're dealing with and

1420
01:14:35,600 --> 01:14:38,719
they're angry that you gave them the

1421
01:14:38,719 --> 01:14:41,159
solution they want to run you around in

1422
01:14:41,159 --> 01:14:44,320
the circle of foolishness the circle of

1423
01:14:44,320 --> 01:14:47,719
oh but here's here's what I'm saying it

1424
01:14:47,719 --> 01:14:49,159
doesn't matter what you're saying what

1425
01:14:49,159 --> 01:14:50,719
matters right now is that you need to

1426
01:14:50,719 --> 01:14:52,840
fix the issue that's at

1427
01:14:52,840 --> 01:14:55,400
hand and the only way to fix the issue

1428
01:14:55,400 --> 01:14:57,639
that's at hand is what to deal with it

1429
01:14:57,639 --> 01:15:00,639
to solve it right how are you mad about

1430
01:15:00,639 --> 01:15:03,199
that you mad about solution driven

1431
01:15:03,199 --> 01:15:04,760
people in your life solution-driven

1432
01:15:04,760 --> 01:15:07,040
people care about

1433
01:15:07,040 --> 01:15:09,679
you so the first thing that they answer

1434
01:15:09,679 --> 01:15:12,080
is to give you a solution for it and

1435
01:15:12,080 --> 01:15:14,159
they're direct with you that's someone

1436
01:15:14,159 --> 01:15:16,440
you want to keep in your life that's

1437
01:15:16,440 --> 01:15:18,320
someone that actually cares about what

1438
01:15:18,320 --> 01:15:20,040
you're

1439
01:15:20,040 --> 01:15:22,320
doing you think I want to continue to

1440
01:15:22,320 --> 01:15:24,440
hear you getting clapped and Margin Call

1441
01:15:24,440 --> 01:15:26,880
and blown to smithin because you won't

1442
01:15:26,880 --> 01:15:28,880
even follow the instructions you were

1443
01:15:28,880 --> 01:15:30,480
given and I'm just going to come around

1444
01:15:30,480 --> 01:15:32,400
and massage

1445
01:15:32,400 --> 01:15:34,280
it you

1446
01:15:34,280 --> 01:15:39,080
know it's just the tax that we pay in

1447
01:15:39,080 --> 01:15:41,840
trading you didn't pay any tax that's a

1448
01:15:41,840 --> 01:15:44,199
tax write off you

1449
01:15:44,199 --> 01:15:47,320
lost you lost because you didn't follow

1450
01:15:47,320 --> 01:15:48,719
your rules because you didn't follow

1451
01:15:48,719 --> 01:15:50,639
your plan you

1452
01:15:50,639 --> 01:15:53,920
lost you didn't pay any taxes on

1453
01:15:53,920 --> 01:15:58,080
that so of course I'm going to call it

1454
01:15:58,080 --> 01:16:00,639
out I tell the group all the time show

1455
01:16:00,639 --> 01:16:02,440
me your trading plan that's the next set

1456
01:16:02,440 --> 01:16:04,199
the next you know segment we're going

1457
01:16:04,199 --> 01:16:06,159
into everybody has to show me their

1458
01:16:06,159 --> 01:16:08,880
trading plan and when everyone shows me

1459
01:16:08,880 --> 01:16:10,320
their trading plan guess what they have

1460
01:16:10,320 --> 01:16:13,520
to do when they start posting entries

1461
01:16:13,520 --> 01:16:16,920
I'm going to compare their entries with

1462
01:16:16,920 --> 01:16:19,199
their

1463
01:16:19,239 --> 01:16:21,600
plan compare the

1464
01:16:21,600 --> 01:16:23,920
entries with the

1465
01:16:23,920 --> 01:16:25,639
plan

1466
01:16:25,639 --> 01:16:27,400
and when I compare the entries with the

1467
01:16:27,400 --> 01:16:29,679
plan guess what guess guess what I'm

1468
01:16:29,679 --> 01:16:30,480
going to

1469
01:16:30,480 --> 01:16:34,840
say I'm say oh this this is

1470
01:16:34,840 --> 01:16:38,040
you this you here you said you said you

1471
01:16:38,040 --> 01:16:40,719
count your swings but the LI detect

1472
01:16:40,719 --> 01:16:43,199
determin you you say you you you

1473
01:16:43,199 --> 01:16:45,840
tregging highs and lows and and you wait

1474
01:16:45,840 --> 01:16:47,239
for the fourth swing but the light

1475
01:16:47,239 --> 01:16:51,120
detector determined that that that was

1476
01:16:51,120 --> 01:16:53,760
you said what you said you said when

1477
01:16:53,760 --> 01:16:56,159
you're in a Range you you stay out oh oh

1478
01:16:56,159 --> 01:16:57,880
but this entry the LI detector

1479
01:16:57,880 --> 01:17:00,320
determined

1480
01:17:00,320 --> 01:17:02,600
that and we'll go over it because you

1481
01:17:02,600 --> 01:17:06,920
need to stop going through this cycle of

1482
01:17:06,920 --> 01:17:09,520
insanity that you continue to break your

1483
01:17:09,520 --> 01:17:15,679
rules over and over and over

1484
01:17:15,920 --> 01:17:19,280
again and then you go to seek advice for

1485
01:17:19,280 --> 01:17:22,440
it that's Insanity how can someone give

1486
01:17:22,440 --> 01:17:24,480
you the answer and you go back and do

1487
01:17:24,480 --> 01:17:27,840
the opposite of what they

1488
01:17:28,280 --> 01:17:31,000
said do you actually want to train or or

1489
01:17:31,000 --> 01:17:33,000
you you want you want somebody to talk

1490
01:17:33,000 --> 01:17:35,760
to every time you break your

1491
01:17:35,760 --> 01:17:39,960
rules because I'll give you the therapy

1492
01:17:44,800 --> 01:17:46,840
hotline uh good morning Dave I kept

1493
01:17:46,840 --> 01:17:48,880
finding myself counting more swings than

1494
01:17:48,880 --> 01:17:50,920
four to six should I ignore internal

1495
01:17:50,920 --> 01:17:53,440
swings so you got to go back and watch

1496
01:17:53,440 --> 01:17:58,440
um uh video video what is that video

1497
01:17:58,440 --> 01:18:01,520
two because video two tells you the

1498
01:18:01,520 --> 01:18:04,000
internal swings and the external swings

1499
01:18:04,000 --> 01:18:06,239
they're from different time frames so

1500
01:18:06,239 --> 01:18:08,000
what time frame are you actually

1501
01:18:08,000 --> 01:18:09,840
counting you're not counting the one

1502
01:18:09,840 --> 01:18:13,520
minute swing with a a a 15 minute swing

1503
01:18:13,520 --> 01:18:15,440
or a one minute swing with a five minute

1504
01:18:15,440 --> 01:18:17,679
swing does if if you're going to get

1505
01:18:17,679 --> 01:18:19,400
four on the five minute how many do you

1506
01:18:19,400 --> 01:18:22,080
think is going to show itself on the the

1507
01:18:22,080 --> 01:18:23,760
one

1508
01:18:23,760 --> 01:18:27,000
minute so the swings are relative to the

1509
01:18:27,000 --> 01:18:29,679
time frames that you were trading from

1510
01:18:29,679 --> 01:18:33,320
so you got to make sure you you do

1511
01:18:33,560 --> 01:18:36,560
that

1512
01:18:39,159 --> 01:18:41,600
um best teachers tell you the truth

1513
01:18:41,600 --> 01:18:43,080
truth tellers never have friends that's

1514
01:18:43,080 --> 01:18:44,960
what my dad said my dad said that the

1515
01:18:44,960 --> 01:18:46,199
truth has no

1516
01:18:46,199 --> 01:18:49,040
friends he's 100%

1517
01:18:49,040 --> 01:18:51,480
true you ain't never lie about that the

1518
01:18:51,480 --> 01:18:53,719
Troth has no

1519
01:18:53,719 --> 01:18:57,199
friends hey Prof I know your your

1520
01:18:57,199 --> 01:19:00,000
uh I know you you're

1521
01:19:00,000 --> 01:19:07,360
weekly weekly open taret just hit I hear

1522
01:19:10,360 --> 01:19:12,760
that I started watching Co correct me if

1523
01:19:12,760 --> 01:19:15,360
I'm wrong if I want to trade on the one

1524
01:19:15,360 --> 01:19:17,800
minute I should watch the 15 minute

1525
01:19:17,800 --> 01:19:19,880
overall trend

1526
01:19:19,880 --> 01:19:23,760
um that that's a good start yeah but you

1527
01:19:23,760 --> 01:19:25,639
don't need the 15 minute you don't need

1528
01:19:25,639 --> 01:19:27,239
the 4 Hour you don't need any other time

1529
01:19:27,239 --> 01:19:29,280
frame above you other than one minute

1530
01:19:29,280 --> 01:19:32,639
but you need to know how it all looks

1531
01:19:32,639 --> 01:19:35,560
together so if you pay attention to how

1532
01:19:35,560 --> 01:19:40,000
it all plays out together then that's

1533
01:19:40,000 --> 01:19:42,199
going to help you to understand that you

1534
01:19:42,199 --> 01:19:46,080
could see the 15 minute in the one

1535
01:19:46,080 --> 01:19:48,679
minute time frame you could see the 4

1536
01:19:48,679 --> 01:19:52,960
Hour up move on the one minute time

1537
01:19:52,960 --> 01:19:55,199
frame it it doesn't matter matter what

1538
01:19:55,199 --> 01:19:57,040
time frame you're on you just have to

1539
01:19:57,040 --> 01:19:59,199
know what it's doing how it's

1540
01:19:59,199 --> 01:20:02,400
moving and how it looks from lower time

1541
01:20:02,400 --> 01:20:04,920
frame to higher time

1542
01:20:04,920 --> 01:20:07,120
frame so that's going to take a lot of

1543
01:20:07,120 --> 01:20:08,920
work that's going to take back testing

1544
01:20:08,920 --> 01:20:10,840
right most people hate back testing but

1545
01:20:10,840 --> 01:20:12,840
it's the fastest way to collect data and

1546
01:20:12,840 --> 01:20:14,520
I'm not talking about a data driven

1547
01:20:14,520 --> 01:20:17,280
dashboard that tells you whether price

1548
01:20:17,280 --> 01:20:20,639
is is true or false about being bullish

1549
01:20:20,639 --> 01:20:22,520
or bearish I'm talking about the time

1550
01:20:22,520 --> 01:20:24,040
you got to put in that's how you collect

1551
01:20:24,040 --> 01:20:27,040
the data with own

1552
01:20:32,520 --> 01:20:35,040
brain um what do you recommend for those

1553
01:20:35,040 --> 01:20:37,239
like me who picked the wrong last high

1554
01:20:37,239 --> 01:20:40,000
and low back testing I must be picking

1555
01:20:40,000 --> 01:20:43,639
them wrong because the retrace is wrong

1556
01:20:43,639 --> 01:20:47,480
for me that sounds like you're not back

1557
01:20:47,800 --> 01:20:50,280
testing what happens what do you

1558
01:20:50,280 --> 01:20:54,400
recommend when I keep stepping on the

1559
01:20:54,400 --> 01:20:56,719
the the gas instead of the

1560
01:20:56,719 --> 01:20:59,120
break what do you recommend what do you

1561
01:20:59,120 --> 01:21:01,639
recommend if if I

1562
01:21:01,639 --> 01:21:04,480
keep I'm supposed to drive forward and I

1563
01:21:04,480 --> 01:21:06,719
I hit reverse what do you recommend

1564
01:21:06,719 --> 01:21:09,800
that's is the this is time

1565
01:21:09,800 --> 01:21:12,520
right his

1566
01:21:12,520 --> 01:21:16,239
time I recommend you spending more time

1567
01:21:16,239 --> 01:21:19,239
in in you know drawing out the proper

1568
01:21:19,239 --> 01:21:21,600
zones dra you know trailing highs and

1569
01:21:21,600 --> 01:21:23,560
lows I recommend

1570
01:21:23,560 --> 01:21:25,800
that

1571
01:21:25,800 --> 01:21:27,280
time that's

1572
01:21:27,280 --> 01:21:29,480
needed that's what a lot of people think

1573
01:21:29,480 --> 01:21:31,719
time is not needed it's needed you're

1574
01:21:31,719 --> 01:21:35,440
not going to learn this in in in a uh

1575
01:21:35,440 --> 01:21:37,960
you know 10

1576
01:21:37,960 --> 01:21:40,840
days now you learn it in 10 days and now

1577
01:21:40,840 --> 01:21:42,080
you're going to become a millionaire in

1578
01:21:42,080 --> 01:21:44,120
the next 10

1579
01:21:44,120 --> 01:21:46,840
no the fastest way I've ever seen the

1580
01:21:46,840 --> 01:21:48,800
profitability is with profitable losers

1581
01:21:48,800 --> 01:21:50,840
strategy the fastest way guess what you

1582
01:21:50,840 --> 01:21:53,520
still got to put in the time you still

1583
01:21:53,520 --> 01:21:56,520
got to work for it

1584
01:21:56,679 --> 01:22:00,920
still you have to work for

1585
01:22:03,840 --> 01:22:07,639
it still got to work for

1586
01:22:07,639 --> 01:22:11,360
it I know I know I know trust me I know

1587
01:22:11,360 --> 01:22:12,280
I

1588
01:22:12,280 --> 01:22:14,280
know I

1589
01:22:14,280 --> 01:22:18,920
know why is it why is it so

1590
01:22:18,920 --> 01:22:21,280
difficult why do I got to why do I got

1591
01:22:21,280 --> 01:22:23,520
to do all of

1592
01:22:23,520 --> 01:22:25,800
that

1593
01:22:25,800 --> 01:22:28,480
why why does it take all of

1594
01:22:28,480 --> 01:22:31,960
that because it

1595
01:22:32,199 --> 01:22:35,719
does and I I didn't make the

1596
01:22:35,719 --> 01:22:39,679
rules it does take all of

1597
01:22:41,159 --> 01:22:46,040
that I I can't I can't tell you anything

1598
01:22:46,760 --> 01:22:50,719
different there's nothing that I can

1599
01:22:50,719 --> 01:22:55,159
say that will be able to change the fact

1600
01:22:55,159 --> 01:22:58,400
that it it it takes all of

1601
01:22:58,400 --> 01:23:01,400
that

1602
01:23:02,280 --> 01:23:06,159
right nothing that I could

1603
01:23:09,560 --> 01:23:12,320
say

1604
01:23:12,320 --> 01:23:15,320
so you got to make sure that that you're

1605
01:23:15,320 --> 01:23:17,920
willing to to put in the time you're

1606
01:23:17,920 --> 01:23:20,600
willing to do the work you got to make

1607
01:23:20,600 --> 01:23:22,199
sure

1608
01:23:22,199 --> 01:23:25,760
that no one canar

1609
01:23:25,760 --> 01:23:29,480
no one can my man no no one can do

1610
01:23:29,480 --> 01:23:33,880
it no no one can do it but

1611
01:23:35,040 --> 01:23:38,239
you all

1612
01:23:47,239 --> 01:23:51,000
right uh Dave why do I need to learn how

1613
01:23:51,000 --> 01:23:54,520
to walk so I can Sprint hey hey and and

1614
01:23:54,520 --> 01:23:56,440
that that's that's the thing that I'm

1615
01:23:56,440 --> 01:23:59,360
trying to get people to

1616
01:23:59,360 --> 01:24:01,719
understand I'm I'm really trying to get

1617
01:24:01,719 --> 01:24:04,560
people to understand

1618
01:24:04,560 --> 01:24:08,679
that you need to do it in steps it's so

1619
01:24:08,679 --> 01:24:11,120
important do it in

1620
01:24:11,120 --> 01:24:13,679
steps guys why why why did I take a

1621
01:24:13,679 --> 01:24:16,639
short out of here trading back into this

1622
01:24:16,639 --> 01:24:19,800
this uh this imbalance it more than

1623
01:24:19,800 --> 01:24:21,600
likely may go lower but why do I take a

1624
01:24:21,600 --> 01:24:23,320
short there it's probably gonna go back

1625
01:24:23,320 --> 01:24:25,960
in back into that uh there why don't I

1626
01:24:25,960 --> 01:24:27,239
take that short

1627
01:24:27,239 --> 01:24:31,760
there because you count your swings

1628
01:24:31,840 --> 01:24:37,000
right right so let's start one two 3

1629
01:24:37,000 --> 01:24:40,639
four five

1630
01:24:40,639 --> 01:24:44,520
right so now my

1631
01:24:44,520 --> 01:24:48,639
discretion steps up and says hey I'm not

1632
01:24:48,639 --> 01:24:52,639
on this side I'm on that

1633
01:24:52,639 --> 01:24:55,679
side I'm not going to do

1634
01:24:55,679 --> 01:24:59,159
this and and try to take some random

1635
01:24:59,159 --> 01:25:01,719
entry to go higher when I have no idea

1636
01:25:01,719 --> 01:25:02,920
whether another high is going to be put

1637
01:25:02,920 --> 01:25:06,480
in now I'm going to start to look for

1638
01:25:06,480 --> 01:25:12,440
moves for entries that put me in another

1639
01:25:12,440 --> 01:25:15,719
low and should price want to trade

1640
01:25:15,719 --> 01:25:18,480
higher it will trade up above this but

1641
01:25:18,480 --> 01:25:21,159
should price want to go lower it won't

1642
01:25:21,159 --> 01:25:24,119
close above this and it'll end up

1643
01:25:24,119 --> 01:25:26,480
Trading trading back into what previous

1644
01:25:26,480 --> 01:25:28,360
range

1645
01:25:28,360 --> 01:25:30,800
right cting my swings already it's

1646
01:25:30,800 --> 01:25:33,000
automatic for

1647
01:25:33,000 --> 01:25:35,679
me and this is just me back back to the

1648
01:25:35,679 --> 01:25:36,840
live

1649
01:25:36,840 --> 01:25:42,280
account so look yesterday I spent uh uh

1650
01:25:42,280 --> 01:25:45,280
yesterday I spent

1651
01:25:45,400 --> 01:25:48,960
uh let me show

1652
01:25:51,560 --> 01:25:56,239
yall yesterday I spent 20

1653
01:25:58,000 --> 01:26:00,679
yesterday I spent 27 minutes to make 200

1654
01:26:00,679 --> 01:26:04,159
bucks today I

1655
01:26:04,159 --> 01:26:08,239
spent one candle

1656
01:26:08,400 --> 01:26:13,119
into one minute

1657
01:26:13,520 --> 01:26:15,600
into I'm not I'm not doing free

1658
01:26:15,600 --> 01:26:17,480
advertisement for prop firms anymore and

1659
01:26:17,480 --> 01:26:19,360
I don't want to be around prop Traders

1660
01:26:19,360 --> 01:26:22,960
at all because they are gamblers and you

1661
01:26:22,960 --> 01:26:24,960
know it's equivalent to be around people

1662
01:26:24,960 --> 01:26:28,400
who don't have their life in control I

1663
01:26:28,400 --> 01:26:31,199
want to be around people who are trying

1664
01:26:31,199 --> 01:26:33,760
to trade and learn how to become Traders

1665
01:26:33,760 --> 01:26:36,239
learn how to become investors through

1666
01:26:36,239 --> 01:26:38,600
their understanding of how the charts

1667
01:26:38,600 --> 01:26:42,280
move that crowd that crazy wild crowd

1668
01:26:42,280 --> 01:26:44,760
I'm I'm not trying to be a part of

1669
01:26:44,760 --> 01:26:47,000
anymore there's there's not people that

1670
01:26:47,000 --> 01:26:49,480
I that I want to associate with

1671
01:26:49,480 --> 01:26:51,800
anymore so I'm moving away from the

1672
01:26:51,800 --> 01:26:55,119
whole prop scene and I'll go back to

1673
01:26:55,119 --> 01:26:58,280
live trading because I've done it before

1674
01:26:58,280 --> 01:26:59,920
that's how I became profitable trading

1675
01:26:59,920 --> 01:27:02,199
my own

1676
01:27:02,520 --> 01:27:05,040
money you said you never take shorts hey

1677
01:27:05,040 --> 01:27:07,040
what am I going to do take a long while

1678
01:27:07,040 --> 01:27:11,000
while I while I don't my rules is saying

1679
01:27:11,000 --> 01:27:14,239
otherwise I

1680
01:27:14,600 --> 01:27:17,600
can't I can't uh

1681
01:27:17,600 --> 01:27:21,880
uh I can't do anything about

1682
01:27:21,880 --> 01:27:24,400
that my if my rules are telling me

1683
01:27:24,400 --> 01:27:27,000
something else you know what what we got

1684
01:27:27,000 --> 01:27:29,520
to do we we got to follow the

1685
01:27:29,520 --> 01:27:32,520
rules we got to follow what the rules

1686
01:27:32,520 --> 01:27:36,080
say the rules say Hey

1687
01:27:36,080 --> 01:27:38,800
listen will you will you count your will

1688
01:27:38,800 --> 01:27:41,960
you count your 4 to6 SGS did you

1689
01:27:41,960 --> 01:27:44,480
anticipate price reversion and and then

1690
01:27:44,480 --> 01:27:50,199
my my time in the market right my time

1691
01:27:50,199 --> 01:27:51,679
in the

1692
01:27:51,679 --> 01:27:54,639
market my back

1693
01:27:54,639 --> 01:27:57,159
testing my forward

1694
01:27:57,159 --> 01:28:02,480
testing my process when my process says

1695
01:28:02,480 --> 01:28:06,560
this over that I can't go against

1696
01:28:06,800 --> 01:28:09,639
it it's not possible for me to I can't

1697
01:28:09,639 --> 01:28:12,080
go against

1698
01:28:12,960 --> 01:28:16,320
it so as much as I might be thinking hey

1699
01:28:16,320 --> 01:28:19,199
yeah let me take a a long to go

1700
01:28:19,199 --> 01:28:22,080
further that's not a part of my rules

1701
01:28:22,080 --> 01:28:24,440
when when my rules said this is is where

1702
01:28:24,440 --> 01:28:28,159
you stop doing

1703
01:28:28,159 --> 01:28:32,239
that this is where you cut it

1704
01:28:32,560 --> 01:28:36,920
out get rid of that who do you think you

1705
01:28:36,920 --> 01:28:41,080
are you think you control the

1706
01:28:43,119 --> 01:28:47,480
market you think the market runs on

1707
01:28:48,880 --> 01:28:52,880
you no it runs on

1708
01:28:52,880 --> 01:28:56,040
rules right

1709
01:28:58,280 --> 01:29:01,639
and rules that you need to

1710
01:29:03,239 --> 01:29:06,560
follow that's it

1711
01:29:06,560 --> 01:29:09,159
so if my rules put me on the short side

1712
01:29:09,159 --> 01:29:11,920
I'm on the short side if my rules put me

1713
01:29:11,920 --> 01:29:14,600
on the long side I'm on the long side

1714
01:29:14,600 --> 01:29:18,840
but whatever it is I will not go

1715
01:29:18,840 --> 01:29:22,280
anywhere without following my

1716
01:29:22,280 --> 01:29:26,040
rules all right

1717
01:29:32,080 --> 01:29:33,960
make sure you guys cover the kids yes I

1718
01:29:33,960 --> 01:29:36,480
don't want them

1719
01:29:38,119 --> 01:29:43,119
to I don't want them to to

1720
01:29:44,040 --> 01:29:49,400
um cover the years you need to back

1721
01:29:49,400 --> 01:29:52,080
test

1722
01:29:52,080 --> 01:29:56,719
right you need to back back test

1723
01:29:56,719 --> 01:30:00,800
BBB you need to back

1724
01:30:00,800 --> 01:30:05,800
test that's where that comes from back

1725
01:30:05,840 --> 01:30:08,360
testing your whole life will change the

1726
01:30:08,360 --> 01:30:11,280
minute you back test guys guess what

1727
01:30:11,280 --> 01:30:12,639
this is this is

1728
01:30:12,639 --> 01:30:16,199
retail this is this is retail oh my

1729
01:30:16,199 --> 01:30:18,239
goodness it's loud in my ears you just

1730
01:30:18,239 --> 01:30:21,159
they just they just ping me aggressive

1731
01:30:21,159 --> 01:30:22,480
you you she ain't even want to pay me

1732
01:30:22,480 --> 01:30:26,000
she said Target buil y y'all hear how

1733
01:30:26,000 --> 01:30:28,440
loud that was this is retail support and

1734
01:30:28,440 --> 01:30:30,440
resistance right we said it all works

1735
01:30:30,440 --> 01:30:32,880
right so they get the false break up

1736
01:30:32,880 --> 01:30:35,760
above right no body right trades back

1737
01:30:35,760 --> 01:30:38,000
below they get the body break and on

1738
01:30:38,000 --> 01:30:39,360
their body break what are they

1739
01:30:39,360 --> 01:30:43,080
anticipating price trading back

1740
01:30:43,080 --> 01:30:46,119
into what what should be

1741
01:30:46,119 --> 01:30:49,040
support to try and trade higher there

1742
01:30:49,040 --> 01:30:51,960
are times where that fails for them and

1743
01:30:51,960 --> 01:30:54,679
then they end up getting in on

1744
01:30:54,679 --> 01:30:56,159
the

1745
01:30:56,159 --> 01:31:01,880
breakdown and take it lower it all

1746
01:31:01,880 --> 01:31:05,320
occurs the same exact way it all happens

1747
01:31:05,320 --> 01:31:06,560
it's just

1748
01:31:06,560 --> 01:31:09,760
you it's just you now somebody asked me

1749
01:31:09,760 --> 01:31:13,119
so what zone did you that that's that's

1750
01:31:13,119 --> 01:31:14,440
what you should have learned in back

1751
01:31:14,440 --> 01:31:17,119
testing and all of that other stuff

1752
01:31:17,119 --> 01:31:18,760
that's what you should have learned then

1753
01:31:18,760 --> 01:31:20,760
we have nothing here but this large

1754
01:31:20,760 --> 01:31:22,920
candle that just

1755
01:31:22,920 --> 01:31:25,280
went some of y'all remember that some of

1756
01:31:25,280 --> 01:31:27,760
y'all stop losses got cooked in there

1757
01:31:27,760 --> 01:31:30,440
some y'all remember

1758
01:31:31,159 --> 01:31:36,080
that but you need the right

1759
01:31:37,600 --> 01:31:40,400
side you need to understand how to

1760
01:31:40,400 --> 01:31:42,480
engage so why did I say I was on this

1761
01:31:42,480 --> 01:31:44,840
side

1762
01:31:45,239 --> 01:31:48,520
again because my rules

1763
01:31:48,520 --> 01:31:52,480
for the market trending

1764
01:31:52,480 --> 01:31:56,360
up let me know you need to chill right

1765
01:31:56,360 --> 01:31:58,080
here you a you ain't got to be a part of

1766
01:31:58,080 --> 01:32:01,159
everything but you need to chill right

1767
01:32:01,159 --> 01:32:04,800
here cuz this is either what where we

1768
01:32:04,800 --> 01:32:07,560
range because we took out a old high so

1769
01:32:07,560 --> 01:32:09,520
we end up accumulating above old high so

1770
01:32:09,520 --> 01:32:11,760
this either where we range or this is

1771
01:32:11,760 --> 01:32:14,440
where we reverse

1772
01:32:14,440 --> 01:32:18,800
right range or reverse that's my

1773
01:32:19,199 --> 01:32:22,040
uh Prophet already took his

1774
01:32:22,040 --> 01:32:25,119
Prophet his toar already hit he just

1775
01:32:25,119 --> 01:32:27,560
passed the

1776
01:32:30,119 --> 01:32:33,119
Baton

1777
01:32:34,520 --> 01:32:38,480
so make sure that anything that's taught

1778
01:32:38,480 --> 01:32:41,960
here to you guys on this channel you go

1779
01:32:41,960 --> 01:32:45,199
and you back test you search it out for

1780
01:32:45,199 --> 01:32:48,760
yourself no one else is rebranded oh the

1781
01:32:48,760 --> 01:32:50,840
shorter videos are no you talking about

1782
01:32:50,840 --> 01:32:53,360
shorter videos the problem is you lack

1783
01:32:53,360 --> 01:32:55,840
discipline

1784
01:32:56,560 --> 01:32:58,880
you want shorter videos the only shorter

1785
01:32:58,880 --> 01:33:00,840
videos I recommend you to watch is

1786
01:33:00,840 --> 01:33:02,960
profitable losers

1787
01:33:02,960 --> 01:33:05,280
videos everything else is going to be

1788
01:33:05,280 --> 01:33:08,159
entirely

1789
01:33:09,960 --> 01:33:12,560
complex and if you don't have the

1790
01:33:12,560 --> 01:33:15,239
discipline to follow it all then you

1791
01:33:15,239 --> 01:33:18,480
need to be honest with yourself and say

1792
01:33:18,480 --> 01:33:20,360
hey

1793
01:33:20,360 --> 01:33:23,600
I'm that's that's not for me it's it's

1794
01:33:23,600 --> 01:33:26,080
difficult for me to take it all

1795
01:33:26,080 --> 01:33:29,880
in it's difficult for me to understand

1796
01:33:29,880 --> 01:33:34,159
in detail these things

1797
01:33:35,280 --> 01:33:37,600
occurring so I need something simpler

1798
01:33:37,600 --> 01:33:39,520
you don't bash the person that that has

1799
01:33:39,520 --> 01:33:41,119
something more complex than your brain

1800
01:33:41,119 --> 01:33:43,639
can

1801
01:33:43,960 --> 01:33:46,159
understand you go and search for things

1802
01:33:46,159 --> 01:33:47,760
that are

1803
01:33:47,760 --> 01:33:50,199
simpler told you when I was in mx's

1804
01:33:50,199 --> 01:33:53,480
group 30% win rate there's absolutely no

1805
01:33:53,480 --> 01:33:54,560
way

1806
01:33:54,560 --> 01:33:56,760
that I was that my kids didn't need to

1807
01:33:56,760 --> 01:33:58,960
eat 30% of the time they needed to eat

1808
01:33:58,960 --> 01:34:00,480
more than

1809
01:34:00,480 --> 01:34:04,400
that so why on God's green

1810
01:34:04,400 --> 01:34:07,000
earth would I be hanging

1811
01:34:07,000 --> 01:34:10,440
around a mentor who only wins 30% or I

1812
01:34:10,440 --> 01:34:12,320
don't care about your R get your R out

1813
01:34:12,320 --> 01:34:14,520
of

1814
01:34:15,960 --> 01:34:18,360
here I needed something that did not

1815
01:34:18,360 --> 01:34:20,080
exhaust my mental

1816
01:34:20,080 --> 01:34:22,119
capital and the market was the only

1817
01:34:22,119 --> 01:34:24,320
thing that taught me that nothing else

1818
01:34:24,320 --> 01:34:26,520
no one else the

1819
01:34:26,520 --> 01:34:29,400
market

1820
01:34:29,400 --> 01:34:31,679
market so no matter what you actually

1821
01:34:31,679 --> 01:34:34,440
learn out there no matter what you

1822
01:34:34,440 --> 01:34:37,560
actually learn out

1823
01:34:37,760 --> 01:34:41,360
there you need to be disciplined with

1824
01:34:41,360 --> 01:34:45,520
it you need to test it time and time

1825
01:34:45,520 --> 01:34:48,520
again back test it you can do all of

1826
01:34:48,520 --> 01:34:50,679
this during the during the New York

1827
01:34:50,679 --> 01:34:54,560
session and spend a whole eight hours

1828
01:34:54,560 --> 01:34:58,040
here and guess what you got you got

1829
01:34:58,040 --> 01:35:01,719
eight hours worth of data and that's

1830
01:35:01,719 --> 01:35:04,400
it eight hours worth of data today

1831
01:35:04,400 --> 01:35:07,600
that's going to look a little different

1832
01:35:08,520 --> 01:35:10,520
tomorrow and tomorrow being that it

1833
01:35:10,520 --> 01:35:12,080
looks a little different now you have

1834
01:35:12,080 --> 01:35:14,280
eight hours of data tomorrow that's

1835
01:35:14,280 --> 01:35:15,560
going to look a little bit different the

1836
01:35:15,560 --> 01:35:18,000
following

1837
01:35:18,280 --> 01:35:20,920
day but if you take time to back test

1838
01:35:20,920 --> 01:35:22,440
during that eight hours you could back

1839
01:35:22,440 --> 01:35:24,199
test weeks of days

1840
01:35:24,199 --> 01:35:25,760
in 8

1841
01:35:25,760 --> 01:35:30,600
hours you can you can take one

1842
01:35:30,600 --> 01:35:34,679
hour to back test one New York

1843
01:35:34,679 --> 01:35:37,119
session and soon enough you start to see

1844
01:35:37,119 --> 01:35:38,560
similarities by the time you get to the

1845
01:35:38,560 --> 01:35:41,320
sixth or seventh

1846
01:35:42,199 --> 01:35:44,679
hour but most people think back testing

1847
01:35:44,679 --> 01:35:46,239
don't work and back testing doesn't work

1848
01:35:46,239 --> 01:35:47,679
for people who

1849
01:35:47,679 --> 01:35:51,119
are you know

1850
01:35:51,119 --> 01:35:53,280
unprofitable back testing is not even

1851
01:35:53,280 --> 01:35:55,639
real

1852
01:35:56,400 --> 01:36:00,239
okay whatever you want to say

1853
01:36:02,440 --> 01:36:05,600
okay back testing is the only way for

1854
01:36:05,600 --> 01:36:07,400
you to get this as fast as you need to

1855
01:36:07,400 --> 01:36:12,440
and change your life it is the only way

1856
01:36:12,440 --> 01:36:16,400
the only way and then back testing helps

1857
01:36:16,400 --> 01:36:18,520
you to develop

1858
01:36:18,520 --> 01:36:20,840
rules that's the thing that most of you

1859
01:36:20,840 --> 01:36:25,560
guys are missing rules

1860
01:36:30,560 --> 01:36:33,040
so can't ask me what I was seeing and

1861
01:36:33,040 --> 01:36:35,560
why I thought I was taking a short and

1862
01:36:35,560 --> 01:36:37,600
then and then oh you took another short

1863
01:36:37,600 --> 01:36:40,040
then but what so you couldn't at least

1864
01:36:40,040 --> 01:36:43,639
let us know it no go and back

1865
01:36:43,639 --> 01:36:45,960
test you will never need to depend on

1866
01:36:45,960 --> 01:36:47,800
anybody else you think somebody needs to

1867
01:36:47,800 --> 01:36:49,719
be responsible for feeding my kids more

1868
01:36:49,719 --> 01:36:51,760
than I

1869
01:36:51,760 --> 01:36:55,520
do really

1870
01:36:56,000 --> 01:36:58,280
somebody needs needs to be responsible

1871
01:36:58,280 --> 01:37:03,520
for feeding my kids no me it depends on

1872
01:37:03,520 --> 01:37:07,080
me depends on

1873
01:37:07,719 --> 01:37:10,840
me so I'm taking that into my own

1874
01:37:10,840 --> 01:37:15,119
hands through spending time learning

1875
01:37:15,119 --> 01:37:18,440
what works and what

1876
01:37:22,520 --> 01:37:25,520
doesn't

1877
01:37:29,400 --> 01:37:31,920
so so the way you back test let me this

1878
01:37:31,920 --> 01:37:34,880
is what I do in the group when I back

1879
01:37:34,880 --> 01:37:37,400
toest I scroll out I go all the way back

1880
01:37:37,400 --> 01:37:39,880
to as far as I can I don't know where's

1881
01:37:39,880 --> 01:37:41,360
the furthest right

1882
01:37:41,360 --> 01:37:44,760
here so you see this starts at 1800 I

1883
01:37:44,760 --> 01:37:46,880
might want to move into you know like

1884
01:37:46,880 --> 01:37:49,280
some session that I I may trade you know

1885
01:37:49,280 --> 01:37:51,599
London's nice you know but New York if

1886
01:37:51,599 --> 01:37:53,159
I'm interested in trading New York I'll

1887
01:37:53,159 --> 01:37:55,719
move into New York like this and I'll

1888
01:37:55,719 --> 01:37:59,119
click it like that right so now I don't

1889
01:37:59,119 --> 01:38:01,119
know anything that's occurred within

1890
01:38:01,119 --> 01:38:05,320
here this is March 17th it's currently

1891
01:38:05,320 --> 01:38:07,560
April 11th I don't know anything that

1892
01:38:07,560 --> 01:38:13,199
occurred in here so what I do is

1893
01:38:13,560 --> 01:38:17,199
Click look at what we have

1894
01:38:17,199 --> 01:38:20,560
here and all I see is

1895
01:38:20,560 --> 01:38:23,199
this boy this was the Asia that they

1896
01:38:23,199 --> 01:38:25,840
just started

1897
01:38:26,639 --> 01:38:29,199
running all I see is

1898
01:38:29,199 --> 01:38:32,639
this so now that I have this

1899
01:38:32,639 --> 01:38:35,159
here what am I instantly doing

1900
01:38:35,159 --> 01:38:38,480
identifying where my highs and lows

1901
01:38:38,480 --> 01:38:41,320
are I don't know if price came from down

1902
01:38:41,320 --> 01:38:42,920
here I don't know if price came from up

1903
01:38:42,920 --> 01:38:45,119
there all I know is that I

1904
01:38:45,119 --> 01:38:48,440
have that high and low I have another

1905
01:38:48,440 --> 01:38:50,520
high and low in here I have another high

1906
01:38:50,520 --> 01:38:52,679
and low in there and they're relative to

1907
01:38:52,679 --> 01:38:54,400
the time frame that that they come from

1908
01:38:54,400 --> 01:38:59,199
right so in video three I mentioned how

1909
01:38:59,199 --> 01:39:01,400
to figure out what time frame you're

1910
01:39:01,400 --> 01:39:02,840
swings come

1911
01:39:02,840 --> 01:39:06,239
from please watch the material that's

1912
01:39:06,239 --> 01:39:07,560
why you're getting cooked every day

1913
01:39:07,560 --> 01:39:09,040
because you have no discipline to sit

1914
01:39:09,040 --> 01:39:10,400
down and watch that but you want to

1915
01:39:10,400 --> 01:39:12,199
watch the fight right you could have a

1916
01:39:12,199 --> 01:39:14,920
large conversation a long conversation

1917
01:39:14,920 --> 01:39:16,760
about who won the fight you could talk

1918
01:39:16,760 --> 01:39:18,679
about what pu said to Tucker you could

1919
01:39:18,679 --> 01:39:20,199
talk about all these different things

1920
01:39:20,199 --> 01:39:21,880
you can't talk about what what time

1921
01:39:21,880 --> 01:39:23,719
frame your swings are from and it's

1922
01:39:23,719 --> 01:39:25,119
literally right

1923
01:39:25,119 --> 01:39:26,719
there

1924
01:39:26,719 --> 01:39:28,760
but

1925
01:39:28,760 --> 01:39:32,040
digress so I have three swings

1926
01:39:32,040 --> 01:39:36,199
here so I'm of the understanding that if

1927
01:39:36,199 --> 01:39:39,199
we put in another swing here if we let's

1928
01:39:39,199 --> 01:39:40,920
say we go down put another swing here

1929
01:39:40,920 --> 01:39:43,040
another high there we got that one right

1930
01:39:43,040 --> 01:39:46,360
there that's the fourth one so now what

1931
01:39:46,360 --> 01:39:48,840
am I doing with the no noticing that

1932
01:39:48,840 --> 01:39:51,679
there's a fourth swing now I'm

1933
01:39:51,679 --> 01:39:56,560
anticipating what a potential range

1934
01:39:56,560 --> 01:40:00,400
right we could end up ranging shooting

1935
01:40:00,400 --> 01:40:02,840
back up above this and then dipping

1936
01:40:02,840 --> 01:40:06,320
below the range only to go back into the

1937
01:40:06,320 --> 01:40:09,560
range there that's from my understanding

1938
01:40:09,560 --> 01:40:11,679
of already knowing how price moves

1939
01:40:11,679 --> 01:40:13,760
you're never going to be there at least

1940
01:40:13,760 --> 01:40:16,159
not right

1941
01:40:16,679 --> 01:40:20,760
now but that's from my

1942
01:40:21,599 --> 01:40:25,679
understanding so if you play it

1943
01:40:27,760 --> 01:40:31,360
forward there's the other

1944
01:40:35,560 --> 01:40:38,000
swing we putting this Higher One there's

1945
01:40:38,000 --> 01:40:41,080
range that we talked

1946
01:40:41,080 --> 01:40:44,280
about and we get back in there back back

1947
01:40:44,280 --> 01:40:47,199
at the bottom of this range here we say

1948
01:40:47,199 --> 01:40:48,760
we accumulating right we go back below

1949
01:40:48,760 --> 01:40:50,639
this range right oh my oh my goodness

1950
01:40:50,639 --> 01:40:53,560
wait did did he schedule this he he had

1951
01:40:53,560 --> 01:40:57,159
to did he scheduled

1952
01:41:03,920 --> 01:41:06,719
this I can speed up and do that you

1953
01:41:06,719 --> 01:41:10,440
cannot you need to follow your highs and

1954
01:41:10,440 --> 01:41:13,360
lows and you need to take trades within

1955
01:41:13,360 --> 01:41:15,719
your understanding of what these highs

1956
01:41:15,719 --> 01:41:18,199
and lows

1957
01:41:22,239 --> 01:41:24,159
are

1958
01:41:24,159 --> 01:41:27,840
but you you're not going to you know

1959
01:41:27,840 --> 01:41:30,760
come to any real conclusion of

1960
01:41:30,760 --> 01:41:33,320
that if you don't

1961
01:41:33,320 --> 01:41:35,880
first understand the

1962
01:41:35,880 --> 01:41:41,719
material if you don't first learn the

1963
01:41:43,239 --> 01:41:48,840
material you need to learn the

1964
01:41:50,960 --> 01:41:56,159
material y'all hear me you need to learn

1965
01:41:56,159 --> 01:41:57,000
the

1966
01:41:57,000 --> 01:42:00,080
material you need to there's no if ends

1967
01:42:00,080 --> 01:42:02,159
or butts about

1968
01:42:02,159 --> 01:42:05,440
it you need to learn the

1969
01:42:05,440 --> 01:42:07,719
material that's the only way that that

1970
01:42:07,719 --> 01:42:09,960
you're going to you know find any

1971
01:42:09,960 --> 01:42:11,440
success than doing

1972
01:42:11,440 --> 01:42:15,400
this I don't care what you think about

1973
01:42:15,400 --> 01:42:17,920
what you actually need to utilize to

1974
01:42:17,920 --> 01:42:20,599
trade with and and how you just need to

1975
01:42:20,599 --> 01:42:23,639
see another person's entries and I don't

1976
01:42:23,639 --> 01:42:26,719
care about any of

1977
01:42:28,040 --> 01:42:30,840
that if you don't have the knowledge of

1978
01:42:30,840 --> 01:42:33,880
of what they're executing

1979
01:42:33,880 --> 01:42:37,119
on how they're

1980
01:42:37,119 --> 01:42:40,920
executing then you're never going to

1981
01:42:40,920 --> 01:42:44,719
understand why they took the entry they

1982
01:42:44,719 --> 01:42:48,719
took you're never going to understand

1983
01:42:51,719 --> 01:42:53,679
that chat when

1984
01:42:53,679 --> 01:42:56,880
silent Dave after the droids yeah I'm

1985
01:42:56,880 --> 01:43:00,000
I'm sure they they got a little surprise

1986
01:43:00,000 --> 01:43:02,400
on that but surprise surprise you can

1987
01:43:02,400 --> 01:43:04,960
learn on your own

1988
01:43:04,960 --> 01:43:09,159
too you can do it by yourself as

1989
01:43:09,159 --> 01:43:13,280
well you don't need anybody

1990
01:43:13,320 --> 01:43:17,599
else you don't need anyone else but

1991
01:43:17,599 --> 01:43:20,239
you I promise you that you don't need

1992
01:43:20,239 --> 01:43:22,119
anyone else but

1993
01:43:22,119 --> 01:43:25,119
you

1994
01:43:28,080 --> 01:43:30,440
so Dave have you considered packaging

1995
01:43:30,440 --> 01:43:32,880
your knowledge in a free

1996
01:43:32,880 --> 01:43:35,560
PDF or maybe a series of videos with a

1997
01:43:35,560 --> 01:43:38,599
catchy name maybe top class or master

1998
01:43:38,599 --> 01:43:42,000
plan no I haven't thought about

1999
01:43:42,000 --> 01:43:46,000
that those things don't really

2000
01:43:46,679 --> 01:43:52,040
work they they don't you know as much as

2001
01:43:52,040 --> 01:43:55,480
we you know love to see a PDF as much as

2002
01:43:55,480 --> 01:43:57,440
we th those things are not going to help

2003
01:43:57,440 --> 01:44:00,199
no one's going to really learn from that

2004
01:44:00,199 --> 01:44:01,920
there's so many PDFs out there of how to

2005
01:44:01,920 --> 01:44:04,360
trade ICT Concepts why nobody why nobody

2006
01:44:04,360 --> 01:44:05,880
know anything from

2007
01:44:05,880 --> 01:44:09,480
that why people still

2008
01:44:11,199 --> 01:44:13,960
struggling here are the fbgs you use are

2009
01:44:13,960 --> 01:44:16,880
you still getting cooked on

2010
01:44:18,280 --> 01:44:25,040
fbgs so no not not interested in it

2011
01:44:34,920 --> 01:44:36,440
I already screenshot the videos and

2012
01:44:36,440 --> 01:44:39,280
studi the concepts I don't

2013
01:44:39,280 --> 01:44:42,199
understand um screenshot the concepts I

2014
01:44:42,199 --> 01:44:44,040
don't understand and do it again so back

2015
01:44:44,040 --> 01:44:45,560
testing is going to be the thing that

2016
01:44:45,560 --> 01:44:47,199
that changes it all for

2017
01:44:47,199 --> 01:44:50,480
you I'm telling you nothing else but

2018
01:44:50,480 --> 01:44:54,000
back testing nothing else else but back

2019
01:44:54,000 --> 01:44:58,400
y y'all hear me nothing else but back

2020
01:44:58,400 --> 01:45:00,920
testing or else you willing to sit here

2021
01:45:00,920 --> 01:45:03,440
for the next five years and and come to

2022
01:45:03,440 --> 01:45:05,159
the conclusion of whatever price is

2023
01:45:05,159 --> 01:45:07,440
doing every single day that you come

2024
01:45:07,440 --> 01:45:09,000
here to trade unless you're willing to

2025
01:45:09,000 --> 01:45:10,080
do

2026
01:45:10,080 --> 01:45:12,520
that if you're willing to do that then

2027
01:45:12,520 --> 01:45:14,040

2042
01:46:05,000 --> 01:46:07,080
mentorship and you asking that you got

2043
01:46:07,080 --> 01:46:08,239
to be

2044
01:46:08,239 --> 01:46:11,480
crazy literally that's a short there's

2045
01:46:11,480 --> 01:46:14,239
two short videos three short videos of

2046
01:46:14,239 --> 01:46:16,639
that and you just want something else no

2047
01:46:16,639 --> 01:46:19,480
you don't want to back test just say

2048
01:46:19,480 --> 01:46:21,800
that you don't want to back test you

2049
01:46:21,800 --> 01:46:23,199
don't want to be accountable to how you

2050
01:46:23,199 --> 01:46:25,960
spend your time you just want it quick

2051
01:46:25,960 --> 01:46:31,719
fast and easy right you want it Vegas

2052
01:46:33,199 --> 01:46:35,280
style you should not be using the

2053
01:46:35,280 --> 01:46:36,719
seconds time frame if you're not

2054
01:46:36,719 --> 01:46:40,000
profitable with the lower time

2055
01:46:40,040 --> 01:46:42,119
frames you should not be using the

2056
01:46:42,119 --> 01:46:43,480
seconds time frame if you're not

2057
01:46:43,480 --> 01:46:46,719
profitable with the lower time

2058
01:46:47,000 --> 01:46:49,080
frames you should not be using the

2059
01:46:49,080 --> 01:46:50,400
seconds time frame if you're not

2060
01:46:50,400 --> 01:46:54,159
profitable with the lower time frames

2061
01:46:54,159 --> 01:46:57,159
people want to use the the 5sec chart

2062
01:46:57,159 --> 01:46:59,199
you know and all of that you you should

2063
01:46:59,199 --> 01:47:01,040
you should not be down on those lower

2064
01:47:01,040 --> 01:47:02,080
time frames if you're not even

2065
01:47:02,080 --> 01:47:04,560
profitable on a one minute it makes no

2066
01:47:04,560 --> 01:47:06,679
sense for you to be down

2067
01:47:06,679 --> 01:47:08,719
there that's how to lose your account

2068
01:47:08,719 --> 01:47:11,159
and 10

2069
01:47:21,840 --> 01:47:25,320
trades people should go for what they

2070
01:47:25,320 --> 01:47:28,280
resonate with then when I watch video 3

2071
01:47:28,280 --> 01:47:31,360
I know I have found my holy Grill uh

2072
01:47:31,360 --> 01:47:33,560
thanks Dave don't worry you GNA be back

2073
01:47:33,560 --> 01:47:36,480
here asking more questions after

2074
01:47:36,480 --> 01:47:38,880
that he said he found the holy GRA with

2075
01:47:38,880 --> 01:47:41,119
one

2076
01:47:42,760 --> 01:47:44,760
video uh do you have any advice on

2077
01:47:44,760 --> 01:47:47,119
overcoming external pressures when

2078
01:47:47,119 --> 01:47:50,760
trading financial and emotional um

2079
01:47:50,760 --> 01:47:54,599
unfortunately you know my reason why was

2080
01:47:54,599 --> 01:47:58,400
enough for me to follow my trade plan my

2081
01:47:58,400 --> 01:47:59,880
reason

2082
01:47:59,880 --> 01:48:02,440
why that was my

2083
01:48:02,440 --> 01:48:05,560
kids that was me not having enough money

2084
01:48:05,560 --> 01:48:08,119
to buy food for

2085
01:48:08,119 --> 01:48:11,400
them it was me skipping meals and them

2086
01:48:11,400 --> 01:48:13,840
listening to the landlord knock on the

2087
01:48:13,840 --> 01:48:17,280
door when I didn't have money to keep

2088
01:48:17,280 --> 01:48:21,400
the roof over our head and I prioritized

2089
01:48:21,400 --> 01:48:27,400
wasting my time wasting my

2090
01:48:27,400 --> 01:48:30,880
life that's what I

2091
01:48:31,119 --> 01:48:35,960
prioritized I prioritize that cover K is

2092
01:48:35,960 --> 01:48:39,599
yo I prioritize

2093
01:48:39,599 --> 01:48:41,159
that

2094
01:48:41,159 --> 01:48:43,840
wasting wasting my

2095
01:48:43,840 --> 01:48:47,119
time and

2096
01:48:47,679 --> 01:48:50,480
wasting my life that that's what I was

2097
01:48:50,480 --> 01:48:53,400
doing and when I looked up

2098
01:48:53,400 --> 01:48:56,599
I realized how much I lost and how much

2099
01:48:56,599 --> 01:49:00,400
more they lost because what I wasn't

2100
01:49:00,400 --> 01:49:03,080
following a plan I wasn't following

2101
01:49:03,080 --> 01:49:05,480
rules I wasn't thinking about ahead

2102
01:49:05,480 --> 01:49:08,320
instead of right

2103
01:49:09,840 --> 01:49:14,199
now it's crazy

2104
01:49:14,199 --> 01:49:17,520
right it's

2105
01:49:19,760 --> 01:49:23,239
crazy so I owed it to them

2106
01:49:23,239 --> 01:49:27,920
to develop a set of rules that I did not

2107
01:49:27,920 --> 01:49:30,440
disobey because it wasn't even for me it

2108
01:49:30,440 --> 01:49:34,360
wasn't for the lambo it wasn't for the

2109
01:49:34,360 --> 01:49:36,639
Mansion it was to keep

2110
01:49:36,639 --> 01:49:39,480
shelter over their

2111
01:49:39,480 --> 01:49:43,199
heads it was to keep food on the table

2112
01:49:43,199 --> 01:49:46,080
it was to ensure that when they get to a

2113
01:49:46,080 --> 01:49:50,520
future as adults they could sustain

2114
01:49:50,520 --> 01:49:54,639
themselves that's what it was for

2115
01:49:58,360 --> 01:50:02,280
so you know that that was enough for me

2116
01:50:02,280 --> 01:50:05,800
to say hey Mr

2117
01:50:06,199 --> 01:50:10,360
teachers you you got to follow your

2118
01:50:11,679 --> 01:50:15,960
rules somebody else depends on

2119
01:50:15,960 --> 01:50:18,599
you and I know you're a big fan of doing

2120
01:50:18,599 --> 01:50:21,639
what you want to do but right

2121
01:50:21,639 --> 01:50:25,920
now this ain't the time for

2122
01:50:25,920 --> 01:50:28,400
it and and that changed everything it

2123
01:50:28,400 --> 01:50:30,880
was it was

2124
01:50:32,840 --> 01:50:35,840
accountability

2125
01:50:36,040 --> 01:50:37,880
accountability y see y they they

2126
01:50:37,880 --> 01:50:41,280
dropping back into back

2127
01:50:45,040 --> 01:50:50,199

01:54:06,679 --> 01:54:08,320
and 200 like that's fine they don't like

2188

2192
01:54:18,199 --> 01:54:24,360
so you don't have to you know

2193
01:54:30,679 --> 01:54:32,920
thanks I'm profitable when back testing

2194
01:54:32,920 --> 01:54:35,480
can pass evals but when I get to funded

2195
01:54:35,480 --> 01:54:38,239
I crumble that's because you stop doing

2196
01:54:38,239 --> 01:54:40,239
the things that you did during back

2197
01:54:40,239 --> 01:54:42,159
testing and

2198
01:54:42,159 --> 01:54:44,520
evals back testing the evals is no

2199
01:54:44,520 --> 01:54:46,560
different than a live

2200
01:54:46,560 --> 01:54:49,599
account if I would take this trade in

2201
01:54:49,599 --> 01:54:51,320
back testing the evals I would take this

2202
01:54:51,320 --> 01:54:53,079
trade in Live account if I would count

2203
01:54:53,079 --> 01:54:55,360
my swings in back testing an evils I'm

2204

01:57:53,119 --> 01:57:56,880
that let's let us

2257
01:58:03,639 --> 01:58:08,400
see yeah I can I can test to

2258
01:58:09,800 --> 01:58:14,119
that the market gonna have to show

2259
01:58:15,320 --> 01:58:17,880
me what it's doing I can't tell it what

2260
01:58:17,880 --> 01:58:21,119
it's doing it tells

2261
01:58:21,119 --> 01:58:24,119
me

2262
01:58:34,800 --> 01:58:39,119
yeah it it it tells me I I can't

2263
01:58:42,360 --> 01:58:46,079
say what I think it's

2264
01:58:51,040 --> 01:58:52,880
doing

2265
01:58:52,880 --> 01:58:54,840
our entries suck back test that that's

2266
01:58:54,840 --> 01:58:56,639
what I tell people back testing tells

2267
01:58:56,639 --> 01:58:59,840
you that your entries are

2268
01:59:00,360 --> 01:59:03,440
garbage that's what back testin

2269
01:59:03,440 --> 01:59:05,920
does see a little Wick up above this

2270
01:59:05,920 --> 01:59:08,880
high as well so we Wick below this low

2271
01:59:08,880 --> 01:59:11,040
Wick up above this High we'll see if you

2272
01:59:11,040 --> 01:59:12,520
get a body closure up there it could

2273
01:59:12,520 --> 01:59:14,960
move higher into here but if that Wick

2274
01:59:14,960 --> 01:59:17,560
stays there then you probably end up

2275
01:59:17,560 --> 01:59:20,719
crumbling back below

2276
01:59:21,040 --> 01:59:23,320

so

2449
02:11:53,960 --> 02:11:57,360
uh somebody said

2450
02:11:57,360 --> 02:12:00,920
uh uh where is it um can you explain

2451
02:12:00,920 --> 02:12:03,440
quickly what do you mean by memory so

2452
02:12:03,440 --> 02:12:05,079
this is just the stuff that I remember

2453
02:12:05,079 --> 02:12:06,520
in back

2454
02:12:06,520 --> 02:12:10,199
testing was literally

2455
02:12:10,440 --> 02:12:13,960
that nothing different I just remember

2456
02:12:13,960 --> 02:12:16,920
all of this when I was back

2457
02:12:16,920 --> 02:12:21,360
testing so what I'm teaching is or and

2458
02:12:21,360 --> 02:12:24,559
what I'm trading is based on what I

2459
02:12:24,559 --> 02:12:27,840
remember price to

2460
02:12:27,840 --> 02:12:30,480
do that's why no PDF is ever going to

2461
02:12:30,480 --> 02:12:34,840
help you no short video of nothing is

2462
02:12:34,840 --> 02:12:36,360
ever going to help

2463
02:12:36,360 --> 02:12:40,040
you none of it at all it will never help

2464
02:12:40,040 --> 02:12:42,920
you you have to go through it yourself

2465
02:12:42,920 --> 02:12:45,119
you have to put in the time

2466
02:12:45,119 --> 02:12:47,320
yourself and that's the only thing

2467
02:12:47,320 --> 02:12:50,119
that's that's really going to you know

2468
02:12:50,119 --> 02:12:54,280
change the the way that you

2469
02:12:56,520 --> 02:12:58,480
trade

2470
02:12:58,480 --> 02:13:01,719
so what I'm teaching is from my memory

2471
02:13:01,719 --> 02:13:04,040
of a culmination of things that I've

2472
02:13:04,040 --> 02:13:08,599
learned and found it works if you do it

2473
02:13:08,599 --> 02:13:10,000
like

2474
02:13:10,000 --> 02:13:14,119
this if you do it this way it works so

2475
02:13:14,119 --> 02:13:15,679
if you actually want to follow me you

2476
02:13:15,679 --> 02:13:19,679
got to follow the the teachings that's

2477
02:13:19,679 --> 02:13:23,119
there it works

2478
02:13:23,440 --> 02:13:27,040
works but all of these same things other

2479
02:13:27,040 --> 02:13:28,639
people

2480
02:13:28,639 --> 02:13:33,400
teach ICT uses

2481
02:13:33,520 --> 02:13:35,760
imbalances some of people use supply and

2482
02:13:35,760 --> 02:13:37,280
demand some people don't some people use

2483
02:13:37,280 --> 02:13:40,280
Elliot wav some people

2484
02:13:40,920 --> 02:13:44,159
don't but whatever it is that I use I

2485
02:13:44,159 --> 02:13:47,360
use it in a way where it works for me

2486
02:13:47,360 --> 02:13:50,840
and I teach based on what works for me

2487
02:13:50,840 --> 02:13:52,840
so guess what if it works for me it

2488
02:13:52,840 --> 02:13:54,520
should work for you too if you apply it

2489
02:13:54,520 --> 02:13:55,599
the same

2490
02:13:55,599 --> 02:13:58,800
way if you apply it the same exact way

2491
02:13:58,800 --> 02:14:00,119
that I teach

2492
02:14:00,119 --> 02:14:03,800
it it should work for

2493
02:14:03,800 --> 02:14:07,360
you because it works for me I'm not

2494
02:14:07,360 --> 02:14:09,000
teaching something that somebody else

2495
02:14:09,000 --> 02:14:12,520
taught and told me it does

2496
02:14:13,199 --> 02:14:17,920
this told me that it does this no I've

2497
02:14:17,920 --> 02:14:20,400
made hundreds of thousands of dollars

2498
02:14:20,400 --> 02:14:23,440
using this

2499
02:14:24,520 --> 02:14:28,119
alone I know it

2500
02:14:29,639 --> 02:14:32,040
works it works so good that people

2501
02:14:32,040 --> 02:14:33,760
accuse me of stealing it from other

2502
02:14:33,760 --> 02:14:35,360
people so why those people not using it

2503
02:14:35,360 --> 02:14:38,239
the same way why they not why do we rate

2504
02:14:38,239 --> 02:14:40,440

2505
02:14:41,559 --> 02:14:44,599

to any of that stuff because we know

what we know what we're

2678
02:28:18,720 --> 02:28:22,520

could anticipate we know like at at

2680
02:28:24,800 --> 02:28:27,000
least myself you know you got some

2681
02:28:27,000 --> 02:28:28,600
students who are streaming and you guys

2682
02:28:28,600 --> 02:28:30,439
need to understand that they're learning

2683
02:28:30,439 --> 02:28:33,880
themselves too so you have to take what

2684
02:28:33,880 --> 02:28:35,399
they're saying with a grain of salt

2685
02:28:35,399 --> 02:28:37,000
because they're learning to develop

2686
02:28:37,000 --> 02:28:39,640
themselves and they're doing it for the

2687
02:28:39,640 --> 02:28:41,200
sake of

2688
02:28:41,200 --> 02:28:44,240
accountability right they're doing it

2689
02:28:44,240 --> 02:28:46,760
for the sake of

2690
02:28:46,760 --> 02:28:50,200
accountability so if they're doing it to

2691
02:28:50,200 --> 02:28:53,279
hold themselves accountable to not take

2692
02:28:53,279 --> 02:28:56,439
dumb entries it's easier for for people

2693
02:28:56,439 --> 02:28:58,960
to hold themselves accountable in

2694
02:28:58,960 --> 02:29:01,720
trading when somebody's watching them

2695
02:29:01,720 --> 02:29:04,760
versus when somebody's not watching them

2696
02:29:04,760 --> 02:29:08,160
so that's why they're doing it it's not

2697
02:29:08,160 --> 02:29:10,160
to say that they're ready to teach

2698

anybody

2699
02:29:12,200 --> 02:29:16,600

2700
02:29:16,600 --> 02:29:18,840

each and every time it doesn't matter we

2729
02:30:36,800 --> 02:30:38,319
trade above a whole High what do we know

2730
02:30:38,319 --> 02:30:39,640
we accumulate we know that when we

2731
02:30:39,640 --> 02:30:41,359
accumulate long as the bottom of the

2732
02:30:41,359 --> 02:30:44,399
range short at the top of the

2733
02:30:44,720 --> 02:30:47,479
range until we get a range failure and

2734
02:30:47,479 --> 02:30:49,240
then price trades what back into the

2735
02:30:49,240 --> 02:30:51,399
range and should price want to go higher

2736
02:30:51,399 --> 02:30:52,840
it trade up above the range but if it

2737
02:30:52,840 --> 02:30:56,560
doesn't it'll trade below and keep going

2738
02:30:56,560 --> 02:30:58,920
down it's the same stuff each and every

2739
02:30:58,920 --> 02:31:02,040

retail we are retail too but what do we

2813
02:34:29,319 --> 02:34:32,200
say we said that they get the break

2814
02:34:32,200 --> 02:34:34,439
above they

2815
02:34:34,439 --> 02:34:38,479
retest the resistance now turn support

2816
02:34:38,479 --> 02:34:40,279
and they look to trade higher you don't

2817
02:34:40,279 --> 02:34:42,760
see them

2818
02:34:43,240 --> 02:34:46,279
there I know over here over here they

2819
02:34:46,279 --> 02:34:47,960
they really they really didn't get the

2820
02:34:47,960 --> 02:34:50,319
best the best kind of I mean yeah it's

2821
02:34:50,319 --> 02:34:53,600
breaking retest there too and trade

2822
02:34:53,600 --> 02:34:57,200
higher that that happened for them there

2823
02:34:57,200 --> 02:34:59,760

[Music]

2912
02:41:48,240 --> 02:41:51,120

02:41:51,120 --> 02:41:53,000
i

2914
02:41:53,000 --> 02:41:54,920

[Music]

2917
02:42:07,940 --> 02:42:11,139
[Music]

2919
02:42:18,160 --> 02:42:21,160
up

2920
02:42:32,479 --> 02:42:34,920
so there there's no limits as far as I'm

2921
02:42:34,920 --> 02:42:36,240
concern there's no limits to your

2922
02:42:36,240 --> 02:42:38,200
accounts I'm going to start copy trading

2923
02:42:38,200 --> 02:42:40,640
the Live account soon so I'm going to

2924
02:42:40,640 --> 02:42:42,840
try to have like four or five of them

2925
02:42:42,840 --> 02:42:44,279
and then copy trade each of them to

2926
02:42:44,279 --> 02:42:46,800
spread the risk across each other and

2927
02:42:46,800 --> 02:42:48,760
that way you don't have to use a large

2928
02:42:48,760 --> 02:42:53,040
contra track size on one position you

2929
02:42:53,040 --> 02:42:55,040
would spread the risk across multiple

2930
02:42:55,040 --> 02:42:56,720
accounts and now you're just copy

2931
02:42:56,720 --> 02:42:58,160
trading

2932
02:42:58,160 --> 02:43:00,359
yourself and then you just pay yourself

2933
02:43:00,359 --> 02:43:02,040
at the end of each day

2934
02:43:02,040 --> 02:43:05,040
right

2935
02:43:18,120 --> 02:43:21,120
